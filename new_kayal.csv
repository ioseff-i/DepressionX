"This is a question that gives me SO MUCH anxiety and stress, please help me out : I am 16M and i have a raised mole above my lip (where a moustache grows)

"How can I (non-religious) help my girlfriend (religious) grieve the loss of her sister? :  Disclaimer: I am NOT depressed. My girlfriend is NOT clinically depressed, but she is struggling. I am posting here because I feel this community may be able to help and some of you may have had similar experiences. 

My girlfriend lost her sister several months ago. It was a senseless, shocking death. 

Here is the problem: her grieving is through her faith. She believes (or tries to believe) her sister is in Heaven.

I am agnostic. I do not struggle with my views, and i do not believe in Heaven. I cannot in good conscience reinforce my gf’s beliefs that her sister is in Heaven, because I sincerely don’t believe that.

I always listen to her. I hug and kiss her. I let her cry in my shoulder. She calls me at work just to hear my voice and I always answer. I wrap myself around her in bed so she has warmth to sleep next to. I encourage her to be the best she can be, because that is what her sis would want. I do my best to make her giggle and laugh, when appropriate. Her emotions are a rollercoaster.

I am doing my best but i am not able to reinforce her faith and further her relationship with God. She has told me this, and we have discussed our religious differences a lot.

What else can i do? I haven’t experienced similar loss. My parents both have lost siblings and i was thinking i could get them closer to her? My folks believe in God, but not heaven (Sikhism).

I am aware religious differences usually end relationships, but that is not the purpose of this post. 

————

tl;dr my religious gf believes her sister is in Heaven and i cannot share that belief. She otherwise loves me a lot and relies on me emotionally. Am I hindering her grieving? How can I help her? She wants me in her life, by the way. 

Thank you all. Please help me help her.",not depression

"I'm so lonely and nobody's favorite : Last night (New Year's Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night's of my life. New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!"" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, ""Just make new friends!"" but that's not how it works. I can't just make new friends because its not that easy. Trust me, if it was i would've made new friends a long time ago. Anyways... thanks for reading",not depression
"Why is it that talking to people about depression is so hard? : Heyo everyone. I'm usually a chipper person outwardly in my day-to-day life. It's all a facade, of course, but I feel like a lot of folks with depression do the same. I'm constantly telling people to be positive, giving career advice, and overall trying to be a decent person for my wife, kids, and co-workers (not my friends, as I have literally none since I graduated college).

Keeping with that, why do I have such a problem talking to my wife about my depression? I feel stupid for complaining about my anxiety over money, debt, and bills. I feel like I'm just bitching when I complain about having to work from home because of a sleep disorder I have. I know I'm a hypocrite when I say ""I need to lose weight"" and then just have absolutely no motivation to actually do it. I whinge about how much my job makes me want to just kill myself but then stick with it because ""It pays the bills."" 

I just make excuses for everything and whinge about everything which leads to me just trying to keep it inside instead. My doctor told me the other day that my sleep apnea (not the disorder I mentioned, that's another one) is extremely severe because I'm so overweight; why don't I just lose the weight? I couldn't bring myself to answer with ""because I'm an unmotivated fat fuck that values my life less than I value the brief happiness I get from drinking soda.""

It's behaviour that we know is self-destructive and I don't want to think I'm the only person that keeps everything bottled up. It leads to days where I'm just really on edge and I feel like even more of a burden than I usually do. The only reason I keep going is because my family needs me for money at this point.

I just wanted a forum where I could whine some without being judged too harshly. Cheers.",not depression

"Warning: semi-explicit: Sexuality. Not Ready for Sex... Normal? : I’m 19, straight had semi- sexual experiences with guys. 1) I don’t know if I like kissing or not. I’ve kissed 4 different guys now all relatively recently too and didn’t get much...any pleasure really from the actual kissing. Maybe that’s chemistry or maybe I just don’t really like kissing. I kinda don’t mind it tho, and actually really like making out but not really because of the kissing but because it’s intimate and hot and fun idk lol. ALSO I feel like I’m way behind with everyone my age not being ready for sex and all but I really think it’s connected to my mental health (me being mild/moderately depressed like 24/7 all the time everyday, mainly everything is somewhat dissatisfying, nothing completely fulfilling). Am I just not ready or is it me being inhibited bc of my mental health? Me not wanting to because no one’s ever made me orgasm except myself (and I’m not even sure I’ve done it before) and I definitely don’t orgasm most of the time that I masterbate which is also rare and I don’t try to explore much cz I’m depressed, lazy, only have desire to do it like 1-2 times a month. I feel like maybe I have a more difficult vag haven’t tried like any toys besides a tiny cheap bullet vibrator which did absolutely nothing for me, inside or on my clit. Am I just not ready for sex cz want it to be with someone meaningful (fulfilling) and that will make me feel ready as well as not being depressed so things will actually be satisfying? Or maybe I just have to learn how to actually get pleasure down there and then I’ll want to do more. Idk what’s normal and what’s not. Turned down sex (and blow jobs, no desire to do that or even TRY it at all) (not willing to try many new things cz of my depression) multiple times cz just no desire to really go for it, do it.",not depression

"My girlfriend is thinking about cutting and I’m not sure how to go about this topic : Hey guys,

So I’ll just give a little background (theres not much that needs to be said really). I’m a M18 and she’s a F16 and we are about 2 months into our official relationship after talking for about 2 months beforehand. She has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better ______(body part like legs or waist). She has told me about how she’s had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. She has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself (which almost everyone does though idk i just thought I should ad even though thats a different topic entirely). She also tends to have severe anxiety (or something) attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. In an effort to be there for her I’ve tried to do the following things (these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike):

- make it known that I am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she’s feeling down.
- actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. Being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it.
- make sure that when we talk about it I focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings (and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess). Also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something
-making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she didn’t have these thoughts so no random (“how are you feeling” etc...)
- and I’ve told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever!

Now I’d be lying if i said I haven’t messed up with doing/keeping those things (in mind). I have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. I’ve kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. Also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it’s just a really sensitive topic as we all know. 

I was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. Any pointers on what I could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? Is there something im not doing that I should be doing? Is there something im doing that I shouldn’t be doing? I love her a lot and I really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts/feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody’s job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this.

Thanks to anyone who responds! You are all loved ❤️",not depression

"NYE doesn't mean anything. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're spending it alone. : I kinda find the idea of new year's resolution incredibly stupid. What makes people think that they'll be able to change their lives only because a number has changed. I've had a lot of great periods in my life where I achieved things I'm still proud of to this day, but none of which had anything to do with a new year's resolution. If you wanna change your life, you can start right now. And if you fucked up today, start tomorrow, not next year. Where I live, NYE has passed, and guess what, I spent it alone, and I'm happy about it. I learned that the best friendship one can ever have is a friendship with oneself. So learn how to enjoy your company. The most important thing is to love yourself, because you've been there for yourself all along and you deserve your love. One last thing I'll say is that you should stop looking at what other people are doing. People can and will do whatever their hearts desire, and that's none of our business.

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

I want to get a tattoo

It was a beautiful moment of light in the darkness for me and much needed. I am overcome with emotion. Right now, I feel like living. Right now, I’m happy to be alive. I just wish this feeling would last...",not depression

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

You may not feel able to change anything. What's the point right? But this year i decided to do some things that may not make me any happier, but will be good and practical hings for me to do that could make me feel normal if i keep doing them:

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to have completed a course of Therapy

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back.

"still can't believe I'm still here. : Yep, I've always have this aspect about my life that things wouldn't go the way as I planned and of course, I'm used to it but there are times that it just pushed me to my limits that makes me want to die. I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. 

Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.

Now I'm regretting that decision.

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. 

Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.

"depressed ex sending weird signals : So after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after I ghosted her boring message,  I texted my ex telling her I cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. She replied with a “yeah well you too” I didn’t reply. Later in the day she sent me a Snapchat telling me she was drunk (New Years eve) nothing else interesting though. I was like yay have fun, and we didn’t talk the rest of the night (she’s in Europe rn I’m in the states). I didn’t send her a happy New Years or anything when it turned midnight here. In the morning I woke up to a “happy New Years, and all the best for you! 🥰” i replied with a “thanks and you too”. No other text communication although I replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. 

I’m confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said couldn’t feel anything, and later said she couldn’t love me or anyone else right now. I find it kind of weird she’d include the lovey emoji, she doesn’t use them much and it’s just something I feel an ex wouldn’t send to someone they broke up with. She’s also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad I ghosted her (understandable) and has never been the type to double text or contact first. 

Any thoughts? I’m not desperate to get back together, I know maybe she’s just trying to be nice and be friends (I’m not interested in a platonic friendship, I’ll be nice and talk sometimes but I’m not going to be friendzoned) but I feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something.",not depression

"How can I (non-religious) help my girlfriend (religious) grieve the loss of her sister? :  Disclaimer: I am NOT depressed. My girlfriend is NOT clinically depressed, but she is struggling. I am posting here because I feel this community may be able to help and some of you may have had similar experiences. 

My girlfriend lost her sister several months ago. It was a senseless, shocking death. 

Here is the problem: her grieving is through her faith. She believes (or tries to believe) her sister is in Heaven.

I am agnostic. I do not struggle with my views, and i do not believe in Heaven. I cannot in good conscience reinforce my gf’s beliefs that her sister is in Heaven, because I sincerely don’t believe that.

I always listen to her. I hug and kiss her. I let her cry in my shoulder. She calls me at work just to hear my voice and I always answer. I wrap myself around her in bed so she has warmth to sleep next to. I encourage her to be the best she can be, because that is what her sis would want. I do my best to make her giggle and laugh, when appropriate. Her emotions are a rollercoaster.

I am doing my best but i am not able to reinforce her faith and further her relationship with God. She has told me this, and we have discussed our religious differences a lot.

What else can i do? I haven’t experienced similar loss. My parents both have lost siblings and i was thinking i could get them closer to her? My folks believe in God, but not heaven (Sikhism).

I am aware religious differences usually end relationships, but that is not the purpose of this post. 

————

tl;dr my religious gf believes her sister is in Heaven and i cannot share that belief. She otherwise loves me a lot and relies on me emotionally. Am I hindering her grieving? How can I help her? She wants me in her life, by the way. 

Thank you all. Please help me help her.",not depression

"About the bullshit that the media feeds us. : I think that a lot of my depression is caused by the extreme dissonance between what the ideal lifestyle portrayed by the media is and how my life truly is.

This ideal lifestyle consists in:

-Studying hard and going to college.
-Partying and having loads of sex.
-Getting hired for a nice job position.
-Buying a big house and a expensive car.
-Marrying a beautiful man/woman and having kids.
-Traveling the world.

This crap sets some high expectations that are unattainable and I believe it fucks with peoples mental health. My life goes more like this:

-Going to school to become another sheep of the flock, a productive member of society.
-Working my life away just to be able to scrape by. Just so the mega rich can get richer.
-Barely no social life. No girlfriend/boyfriend.

"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression
"Do people just fake being excited? : Recently there was Christmas and yesterday there was New Year’s Eve. I don’t know about other people but me personally, there wasn’t a moment when I felt exited about my presents (even though I got actually good ones) or when we entered 2020. I just felt numb, people seemed to be happy/excited and all so I just went along with it and put on a fake smile, said thank you for the presents to be polite and during New Year’s Eve people shouted « Happy new year! » with a big smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and I didn’t want to ruin the moment so I smiled and said it back but in reality I couldn’t give less shit about starting a new year. I just... felt numb. Empty. As if it was just another normal day except the food for dinner was quite nice. I honestly would’ve rather get a good night sleep than stay up until 3am. 

So here’s my question: do people fake being excited during such events?",not depression
"I'm so lonely and nobody's favorite : Last night (New Year's Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night's of my life. New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!"" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, ""Just make new friends!"" but that's not how it works. I can't just make new friends because its not that easy. Trust me, if it was i would've made new friends a long time ago. Anyways... thanks for reading",not depression

"Warning: semi-explicit: Sexuality. Not Ready for Sex... Normal? : I’m 19, straight had semi- sexual experiences with guys. 1) I don’t know if I like kissing or not. I’ve kissed 4 different guys now all relatively recently too and didn’t get much...any pleasure really from the actual kissing. Maybe that’s chemistry or maybe I just don’t really like kissing. I kinda don’t mind it tho, and actually really like making out but not really because of the kissing but because it’s intimate and hot and fun idk lol. ALSO I feel like I’m way behind with everyone my age not being ready for sex and all but I really think it’s connected to my mental health (me being mild/moderately depressed like 24/7 all the time everyday, mainly everything is somewhat dissatisfying, nothing completely fulfilling). Am I just not ready or is it me being inhibited bc of my mental health? Me not wanting to because no one’s ever made me orgasm except myself (and I’m not even sure I’ve done it before) and I definitely don’t orgasm most of the time that I masterbate which is also rare and I don’t try to explore much cz I’m depressed, lazy, only have desire to do it like 1-2 times a month. I feel like maybe I have a more difficult vag haven’t tried like any toys besides a tiny cheap bullet vibrator which did absolutely nothing for me, inside or on my clit. Am I just not ready for sex cz want it to be with someone meaningful (fulfilling) and that will make me feel ready as well as not being depressed so things will actually be satisfying? Or maybe I just have to learn how to actually get pleasure down there and then I’ll want to do more. Idk what’s normal and what’s not. Turned down sex (and blow jobs, no desire to do that or even TRY it at all) (not willing to try many new things cz of my depression) multiple times cz just no desire to really go for it, do it.",not depression

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

I want to get a tattoo

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. 

Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.

"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression

"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

""To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

I want to get a tattoo

We’ve all made it into 2020, even though some of us have been hanging by a thread. With a new year ahead of us, let’s think of what’s been going *right* in our lives.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. 

Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.

Now I'm regretting that decision.

"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression

Balancing reaching out and giving space? What’s the best for a friend to do? : [removed],not depression
"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

I don’t consider myself fat anymore but I’m still really ugly. I have deep dark circles that are genetic and have a unibrow because my mom won’t let me wax them. I recently also got glasses. Although I  think that the glasses don’t make me look more awful and I’m working on improving my eyesight, I hate my face. 

I don’t feel like going out anymore and I overthink things so much in every situation. I try to be open and funny but find myself questioning everything I said after a conversation and beating myself up about even the slightest awkward remark. 

In the holdiays I don’t go out for the whole month and at school I always try to conver my face. 

Although I don’t think I have depression, it really affects my life because it’s about thinks I cannot change. I’m already in my senior year so I try to focus more on studies and tell myself I’ll fix myself up when I go to college.

Honestly feels so good to vent this out because I hate my face so much.

"Depression is a chronic illness : My sister’s friend just got diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 19. She had to have her thyroid removed and will be fine, but it will be something she has to deal with for the rest of her life. She has gotten an outpouring of support from friends and family, just hundreds of people showering her with love. She has been very open with my sister and her other friends about how hard this has been for her, throwing off her life plan and setting her potentially on a difference course.

I feel incredibly bad for her and recognize how horrible and life-changing this is, but I also can’t help but feel a little bit jealous. Jealous that she can be so vocal about her frustrations and her illness and receive nothing but empathy and love from absolutely everyone. 

I (22) developed major depression at about 19 and it completely destroyed me and my life plan. It will be something I have to deal with everyday for my rest of my life, and I will never be the same. But I don’t get to talk about it with people. 

While my sister’s friend is labeled strong for dealing with her cancer, I’m labeled weak for being depressed. People view her cancer as a problem she deals with while instead viewing me as a problem for having depression. Even people who are generally sympathetic and kind still think this way and it shows in small ways. Even my parents who are supportive and loving see my persistent depression as a failure on my part. 

I used to be beautiful, smart, and advantaged. But now I can’t sleep, I can’t think, I can’t enjoy anything, I can’t form meaningful relationships, and I see absolutely no future for myself. 

But worst of all, I can’t talk about it because to other people it’s something I’ve done to myself.",not depression

I've always struggled with work and depression, the anxiety of knowing I have a responsibility, knowing I have to go somewhere and do things, be around other people all day etc. It's too much. It feels like I'll never be able to just work and function like a person, live a life. Everything is too much and all I want to do is sleep.

"Depression is shit. If you're here you're not alone. A message for the New Year. : Seemed like the right evening for this poem. Depression is so hard and so horrible. It is sometimes impossible to find a glimmer, but if you can, whatever it is, grab it. Day by day, you're not alone. Remember you're a good person. Things can get better. There's a spark in you somewhere. Dig it out, whatever it takes, there are no rules. Respect to you all for the new year.

 *You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it--it's the*   
*only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks*   
*your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually*   
*drunk.*  
 *But on what?Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be*   
*drunk.*  
 *And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of*   
*a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again,*   
*drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave,*   
*the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything*   
*that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is*   
*singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and*   
*wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you:""It is time to be*   
*drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, be*  
*continually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish.""*

"Thank you for your support : For 2020,

This was an amazing place to find support and make me feel like I wasn’t  alone, but I think I’m going to say fuck it and try my best to move on so I won’t be stuck in this void, an endless cycle of misery.

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression

"What you can do to make 2020 a better year : Mental Illness is something that drains the life out of people and makes it hard to cope with everyday life. You look at the new year and think ""Fuck, here we go again."" 

You may not feel able to change anything. What's the point right? But this year i decided to do some things that may not make me any happier, but will be good and practical hings for me to do that could make me feel normal if i keep doing them:

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to have completed a course of Therapy

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do. They won't change anything right away but a change of habits is something more beneficial than you think. I think of Depression as a stillness. Moving sometimes by doing these simple mundane things are worth doing for yourself. What little things do you think you could start doing?",not depression

"What are you thankful for? : Depression has a way of casting gloom over everything, stripping out the colors and turning the world grey. We’ve all made it into 2020, even though some of us have been hanging by a thread. With a new year ahead of us, let’s think of what’s been going *right* in our lives.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were. I’m hoping that 2020 can somehow bring more peace to my life than 2019 did, and I’m thankful for that chance.",not depression

"Advice: How to Keep Up With Responsibilities? : Hey everyone. This year I'm going to aim for keeping up with my chores and getting into a healthier routine. 

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back. 

Any tips on how to handle responsibilities and a healthy routine? I've tried a checklist idea (wake up, make bed, brush teeth, eat breakfast, etc.) but never follow through with it.

"still can't believe I'm still here. : Yep, I've always have this aspect about my life that things wouldn't go the way as I planned and of course, I'm used to it but there are times that it just pushed me to my limits that makes me want to die. I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. 

Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.

"Randomly stopped Zoloft : Hey all, I've been on Zoloft/Sertraline since 2010. Was on 100mg for many years until about 6 months ago, when I stopped cold turkey. Obviously this made me go off the rails, so after consulting my therapist, I went back to taking the pills but started off at 25mg for two weeks and then went up to 50mg. My therapist said it didn't sound like I needed to up my dosage anymore. Then I had a good few weeks and stupidly thought I didn't need the pills again anymore. So again I stopped taking them. Now I'm regretting that decision. I have an appointment with my therapist in a couple of weeks, but in the meantime I am wondering if I should start again with 50mg or start the process over again with 25mg.

"How can I (non-religious) help my girlfriend (religious) grieve the loss of her sister? :  Disclaimer: I am NOT depressed. My girlfriend is NOT clinically depressed, but she is struggling. I am posting here because I feel this community may be able to help and some of you may have had similar experiences. 

My girlfriend lost her sister several months ago. It was a senseless, shocking death. 

Here is the problem: her grieving is through her faith. She believes (or tries to believe) her sister is in Heaven.

I am agnostic. I do not struggle with my views, and i do not believe in Heaven. I cannot in good conscience reinforce my gf’s beliefs that her sister is in Heaven, because I sincerely don’t believe that.

I always listen to her. I hug and kiss her. I let her cry in my shoulder. She calls me at work just to hear my voice and I always answer. I wrap myself around her in bed so she has warmth to sleep next to. I encourage her to be the best she can be, because that is what her sis would want. I do my best to make her giggle and laugh, when appropriate. Her emotions are a rollercoaster.

I am doing my best but i am not able to reinforce her faith and further her relationship with God. She has told me this, and we have discussed our religious differences a lot.

What else can i do? I haven’t experienced similar loss. My parents both have lost siblings and i was thinking i could get them closer to her? My folks believe in God, but not heaven (Sikhism).

I am aware religious differences usually end relationships, but that is not the purpose of this post. 

————

tl;dr my religious gf believes her sister is in Heaven and i cannot share that belief. She otherwise loves me a lot and relies on me emotionally. Am I hindering her grieving? How can I help her? She wants me in her life, by the way. 

Thank you all. Please help me help her.",not depression

"About the bullshit that the media feeds us. : I think that a lot of my depression is caused by the extreme dissonance between what the ideal lifestyle portrayed by the media is and how my life truly is.

-Studying hard and going to college.

-Getting hired for a nice job position.
-Buying a big house and a expensive car.
-Marrying a beautiful man/woman and having kids.
-Traveling the world.

This crap sets some high expectations that are unattainable and I believe it fucks with peoples mental health. My life goes more like this:

-Going to school to become another sheep of the flock, a productive member of society.
-Working my life away just to be able to scrape by. Just so the mega rich can get richer.
-Barely no social life. No girlfriend/boyfriend.

"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression
"Do people just fake being excited? : Recently there was Christmas and yesterday there was New Year’s Eve. I don’t know about other people but me personally, there wasn’t a moment when I felt exited about my presents (even though I got actually good ones) or when we entered 2020. I just felt numb, people seemed to be happy/excited and all so I just went along with it and put on a fake smile, said thank you for the presents to be polite and during New Year’s Eve people shouted « Happy new year! » with a big smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and I didn’t want to ruin the moment so I smiled and said it back but in reality I couldn’t give less shit about starting a new year. I just... felt numb. Empty. As if it was just another normal day except the food for dinner was quite nice. I honestly would’ve rather get a good night sleep than stay up until 3am.

"I'm so lonely and nobody's favorite : Last night (New Year's Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night's of my life. New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh!

"Warning: semi-explicit: Sexuality. Not Ready for Sex... Normal? : I’m 19, straight had semi- sexual experiences with guys. 1) I don’t know if I like kissing or not. I’ve kissed 4 different guys now all relatively recently too and didn’t get much...any pleasure really from the actual kissing. Maybe that’s chemistry or maybe I just don’t really like kissing. I kinda don’t mind it tho, and actually really like making out but not really because of the kissing but because it’s intimate and hot and fun idk lol. ALSO I feel like I’m way behind with everyone my age not being ready for sex and all but I really think it’s connected to my mental health (me being mild/moderately depressed like 24/7 all the time everyday, mainly everything is somewhat dissatisfying, nothing completely fulfilling). Am I just not ready or is it me being inhibited bc of my mental health? Me not wanting to because no one’s ever made me orgasm except myself (and I’m not even sure I’ve done it before) and I definitely don’t orgasm most of the time that I masterbate which is also rare and I don’t try to explore much cz I’m depressed, lazy, only have desire to do it like 1-2 times a month. I feel like maybe I have a more difficult vag haven’t tried like any toys besides a tiny cheap bullet vibrator which did absolutely nothing for me, inside or on my clit. Am I just not ready for sex cz want it to be with someone meaningful (fulfilling) and that will make me feel ready as well as not being depressed so things will actually be satisfying? Or maybe I just have to learn how to actually get pleasure down there and then I’ll want to do more. Idk what’s normal and what’s not. Turned down sex (and blow jobs, no desire to do that or even TRY it at all) (not willing to try many new things cz of my depression) multiple times cz just no desire to really go for it, do it.",not depression

"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

"[Resident Physician] Horribly depressed, months after failing to match for residency :  I knew I wanted to be an ER doctor early on in med school. Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. My application, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on board exams with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters of rec (called SLOEs in the EM world) were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Was there some hidden red flag on my application? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I match on March 16, 2020, but statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.

So if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of immediately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing and I'm fairly sure I would off myself if I had to work as an IM or FM doctor for the rest of my shitty miserable life.

I've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I've always been very good at compartmentalizing my emotions and feelings so thankfully no one at work has any idea of how I feel. Pretty sure they would force me to be hospitalized if anyone found out (which obviously would not be good for my future residency prospects). But I'm convinced that if I fail to match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. For one, anyone who has failed to match twice is going to be damaged goods and there's little chance you'll be competitive for \*any\* residency if you try to match again the next year. There just won't be anything worth living for anymore. Having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any decent field outside of medicine would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. My medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in March 2019. We will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged on March 16, 2020 at 11 AM EST, and if I get to continue on my journey to become an ER doctor.

If not...these remaining two months will be my last.",not depression
"would a therapist accept me, or am I overthinking? : ummm well maybe I'm just in a bad mood right now but this mood comes up a few times a month so I guess I'll share.


hobbies are good for nothing more than killing time. as a teenager I loved creative writing but now when I do it it's more out of habit than any love, passion, or enjoyment.

I don't really understand people who look forward to things - I used to! but, well...

I genuinely believe life is no more meaningful than just killing time and busying yourself until you get to die.

I do laugh and have love a lot. I genuinely don't believe I'm depressed. I function well, wake up consistently, study hard and get good grades. not much of a choice on that front, but I know depression is crippling when it comes to things like that.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to find enjoyment or passion in... well, anything?

I consider my view on life a little nihilistic even though I'm regularly and known to be goofy, loud, and outspoken.

even the shows and books and stuff that I think I love don't really trigger much emotion in me. happy or sad. I feel like any reaction I have to my friends (like: ""GOD IM SO SAD ABOUT [chapter]"") is 100% habit.

"My Story : I forgot to take my meds and I can't get to them as I'm staying at a friend's and it would mean waking them up, so I am stuck awake until I leave to go back to London tomorrow at 11am-ish

This year has been probably my toughest ever. I've been trying to come to terms with the ending of a really special friendship between a couple and I, a whole group of friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend I made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart attack. I was made redundant from the first job I have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my role outside of London, I've had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my Dad having a heart attack about two weeks before Christmas.

In the last six months, I've I purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. This was around June time and around that time I met my now ex play partner. As I am on the fetish and BDSM scene, having a play partner is kind of like a FWB but you meet up, hang out, ""play"", have sex, whatever... Problem being, I pretty much fell for her the moment I saw her.

She is everything I want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music (BIG BIG THING for me) and into the same kinks, even the ones I am ashamed of / scared of sharing with others. She always said she wasn't over her ex and didn't want anything serious but with her being exactly what I want in someone, I couldn't help but fall for her. She is literally only the second person ever in my life that when I met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and I felt like my jaw dropped like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf.

She pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid-Oct, I didn't realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. This was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. I broke down to my housemate's girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. I ended up in such a panicked state, I had to call the Samaritans for help. I ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn't amount to much.

I ended up going to the Accident and Emergency (ER to the US readers) because I was so low, I was worried I would do something stupid. They didn't do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which I only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. I have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they've referred me to a psychiatrist but STILL waiting on this too.

I still talk her occasionally but she's super short in her answers and it just hurts. I've only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her IG, I get anxious and upset, but I can't unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn't ready to let go. She's everything I want in someone I just can't bear to think that I could miss out on being with her. We'll end up running into each other at some events eventually but I know I will have to leave because it will hurt too much.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm lost, so lonely, I feel ugly, I'm overweight and no one wants to be with me and no one EVER wants to be with me how I want to be with them.

Since I broke up with my wife at the start of 2015, I have had about eight partnerships but none were anything serious, no matter how much I wanted them to be. It's been ten years since I have felt like I was getting what I needed from a relationship and I'm lonelier that I have ever been. I have some better tools to cope with the down times that I did before but I'm still hurting so so much and I just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love I want to give them, but no one I want to be with, wants me, they never have and I feel like they never will.

I was a really late bloomer in school and I didn't start having relationships till I was 15 plus and then didn't have consensual sex till I was 17 plus and the only reason I did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. I honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and somewhere in my \*\*\*\*ing brain just went ""QUICK! DON'T TURN THEM DOWN! YOU'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE!""

I'm just so so tired, so lonely, so upset and so scared that I'll never be happy again. I don't want my Dad to die before he know I have someone who loves me and I love them. My parents are in their 70's now and they are starting to show real signs of aging and losing either of them could really be the end of me.

Sorry, this post has gone all over the place, just very tired (mentally) and just want someone there to hold me, to give me a kiss, gently stroke my back as they pass me while out with a group of friends, just anything to know that someone cares enough to touch me. I need contact with people, if I were to see friends 99% of the day for a week, but had to physical contact, I might as well have been alone, because I need it to fell like someone cares and right now, no matter how many screenshots I save from those that reply to my posts, no matter how many phone calls, whatsapp's or whatever, nothing can replace that contact, especially from someone that I want to be with and they want to be with me

Making the choice : Sometimes depression really is just a big game and it is all about mentality. It is so hard to make the decision to not give up and to not talk down to yourself. Sometimes i make the choice that I am going to start taking care of myself because I deserve to feel good an healthy but it is so hard to stay in that mindset and so easy to stay unmotivated and just want to fall deeper and deeper into depression. Sometimes I decide i’m not going to care about trying to be happy and I am going to push everyone away to protect myself and because my mind likes to tell me no one cares when people really do. I decide i am not going to talk to anyone and should just accept my suffering and bask in it.

"Depression is a chronic illness : My sister’s friend just got diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 19. She had to have her thyroid removed and will be fine, but it will be something she has to deal with for the rest of her life. She has gotten an outpouring of support from friends and family, just hundreds of people showering her with love. She has been very open with my sister and her other friends about how hard this has been for her, throwing off her life plan and setting her potentially on a difference course.

I feel incredibly bad for her and recognize how horrible and life-changing this is, but I also can’t help but feel a little bit jealous. Jealous that she can be so vocal about her frustrations and her illness and receive nothing but empathy and love from absolutely everyone. 

I (22) developed major depression at about 19 and it completely destroyed me and my life plan. It will be something I have to deal with everyday for my rest of my life, and I will never be the same. But I don’t get to talk about it with people. 

While my sister’s friend is labeled strong for dealing with her cancer, I’m labeled weak for being depressed. People view her cancer as a problem she deals with while instead viewing me as a problem for having depression. Even people who are generally sympathetic and kind still think this way and it shows in small ways. Even my parents who are supportive and loving see my persistent depression as a failure on my part. 

I used to be beautiful, smart, and advantaged. But now I can’t sleep, I can’t think, I can’t enjoy anything, I can’t form meaningful relationships, and I see absolutely no future for myself. 

But worst of all, I can’t talk about it because to other people it’s something I’ve done to myself.",not depression

"Burdens : I have young children. They are burdens. I have to cook for them and clean for them and clothe them and buy them toys. I have been puked on and shit on and snotted on. Today, one of them kicked me in the balls. Once, one of them punched me in the eye and I thought it would fall out. I bathe them and I wipe their asses and I clean their teeth. Not one of them pays rent or takes out the trash.

And I love them, unconditionally. I would die for them. They are the best thing that ever happened to me, period. I look forward to seeing them every day. They make me smile and laugh and I love to make them smile and laugh. They give me purpose. They make me want to be a better person. They make me want to conquer my depression.

Are you a burden? Probably not. But do you feel like a burden? Almost certainly. And you know what? Who fucking cares. Someone out there loves you unconditionally, even if you're a burden. Someone would die for you, even if you're a burden. Do you know that people take care of each other? That we love each other? That's what it means to be human.

You are loved. Whether you know it or not, whether you can admit it or not, you are loved. You are good. The world is better because you are in it.",not depression

I've always struggled with work and depression, the anxiety of knowing I have a responsibility, knowing I have to go somewhere and do things, be around other people all day etc. It's too much. It feels like I'll never be able to just work and function like a person, live a life. Everything is too much and all I want to do is sleep.

He used to tell me that I was the only thing that made him happy inside since he had no friends and that no one else loved him and talked to him. But he took his own life. His parents already knew how suicidal he was in his past but didn’t know about how he felt about taking his own life recently.

I wanted to see what others were saying about it...and it broke my heart. I guess I never realized there were so many others struggling with the same thing. I know many other people have depressions and other struggles, but to see their thoughts and feelings written out was something else entirely. It just made me want to say if you haven’t yet, reach out and try and get the help you need...the help we all need. Talk to friends and family about what you’re going through. Seek out therapy. Maybe consider taking medication. Go out and challenge those dark thoughts we all live with. These were all things I did in the last few years, and while we all know there’s no cure for this, it makes things even the tiniest bit easier. Even on your most hopeless days, it can give you a leg to stand on. Like I said, I’ve never been on this subreddit before, so I’m sorry if I broke any rules or offended anyone.

"I declared my love to her on NYE : It's no secret that I'm in love with this woman. I know it, she knows it, and anyone who has ever seen us together knows it. Like, it's an established fact. I'm smitten and absolutely hypnotized, and she's so far out of my league.

We're not together, like something is causing us each to hesitate, like we make each other nervous (wrong word?). It's like we're doing this dance around each other, and it's confusing, infuriating and exciting all at once.

Large crowds cause me severe anxiety, and I'm prone to depression, so naturally a group of us went out on NYE. Downtown in a huge city. We're in a bar, and she looks at me like she does and I melt. I'm far too drunk to make good decisions, but I lean in where only she can hear and tell her, ""This may ruin everything, and I'm sorry - I am completely in love with you."" I had to get it out, as unnecessary as it really was.

She hugged me really hard for a long time. Then I lost my mind. Panic attack, overwhelmed by the number of people suddenly, combined with an unfair amount of alcohol in my system, I disappeared into the crowd.

When she and our group found me I was 2 miles away, lost, crying, and unable to speak or move. When I could speak, it was single words that were self-deprecating. I'm not sure why I broke down - again, I didn't say anything that wasn't already known - but it's like the act of vocalizing it shattered my universe somehow before I even got a reaction.

For a couple of hours I sat there trying to get control of myself back. And she never left my side, never stopped trying to help me be okay, for the rest of the night.

I've spent every minute since then second guessing myself. The depression hit for no reason and I started beating myself up. It's been full throttle anxiety all day. She has been so reassuring, trying to make me understand that everything is okay. It has taken me 24 hours to accept it.

I have my doubts. I showed the ugly side of me and who in their right mind stays around after that?

"It’s impossible for me to not rely on the company of other people to keep me “happy”. : Hi all, female in her late teens, here. There’s a TLDR (too long didn’t read it) at the end of this post for the short and summed up version, but for more details, read the full post if possible. Thanks &amp; i hope you’re all having a good day :) 

So, I know everyone always says not to rely on others for happiness, but I find it literally impossible. I have hardly any friends anyways, but when I have a falling out with one of them or if I get ghosted by someone I develop a “friendship” with online etc, I fall into the worst state of depression for DAYS. It sounds really sad, I know, but does anyone else have this same problem where you just feel like you can’t be happy or even feel decent without talking to friends or a romantic partner? Or any ideas on how to cope with feeling sad without having to rely on talking to my friends? I’ve gotten suggestions like play video games, go to the gym, read a book, etc as suggestions to keep myself occupied, but none of those really help me, unfortunately ): 

Also, another thing; how do some of you guys cope with being ghosted by someone that you really enjoyed talking to &amp; felt a connection with? For me it’s difficult to just get over it because I get attached to new people/friends suuuper easily and it sucks because internet friendships only really last so long for the most part before you either get ghosted entirely or just fall out of contact. It’s part of the whole “trying not to rely on others” thing for me, because when i get ghosted by someone it hurts and depresses the fuck outta me for a long ass time.

Any advice and or help would be much appreciated!
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. 

*TLDR: How should I try and cope with not feeling so depressed without relying on talking to friends to keep me “happy”? That’s usually the only thing that stops me from breaking down is talking to one of the (few) friends that I still have. Would appreciate some advice/suggestions. Thanks!*",not depression
"My depression has slowly morphed into existential dread : Every time my life slows down I realize... that everything I do is just a distraction. It's all about hiding from reality.

When it's quiet and I'm bored like right now I realize that I'm just a 32 year old man with no close friends, no wife, no useful skills, no direction or dreams. And I'm dying. Like everyone I have a finite amount of time to live, and my youth is almost over.  I've already missed out on so much and time is passing so quickly it's like a rocket sled.

-bake yourself something sweet
-have a dance party with yourself
-do a face mask
-reorganize your room
-watch a comedy

i understand that these things seem super basic and unhelpful, but some days doing anything more than this is nearly impossible.

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. 

Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.

Now I'm regretting that decision.

"Something beautiful I found in YouTube comments and just thought you want to see it : Here it goes:

The most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways - except towards themselves. 
Always remember this. When you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, don't take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early. 
Just pull them aside and let them know it's alright and that we are all lost here. That's all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that doesn't matter, and truly connect with them - even if just for a second - to have a human moment. 
Even subtle eye contact can do it. Just don't let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. Cuz they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world. 
Depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds - for to them, they are alone. Cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can't connect even for a second. And all they want is to be loved. To legitimately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. They need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves. 
They have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. They realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership - and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. To them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. But without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet still feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a TV show and a bowl of ice cream. 
They continually question their purpose - which fuels their creative minds, but if unchecked can lead to self ruin. Maybe find some time in between checking your phone for notifications about sports and watching drama shows on your TV to give them a call and say you love them. It might just be what keeps them on this planet.

"Awareness of depression : Ram Dass has a brilliant way of putting things into perspective. One thing in particular he said about depression really made me change my 'point of view' of my depression and anxiety. He explains how we can seperate 'ourselves' from our self-identification of the depression.
a short part of one of his talks goes something like this:
Person A: I'm really deeply depressed.
Person B: Are you noticing your depression?
Person A: The noticer is just noticing.
Person B: Is the noticer depressed?
Person A: well no, it's just noticing.

"Only one way out... : So im a nursing student who just got placed at a pediatric mental health institute and honestly it scares the shit outta me. There are 9 year olds that are taking medications for depression and even 12 year olds that want to kill themselves. I wonder how these kids havent even started life and they are already hating it. It honestly sucks. Tbh I went through a period of time where I was depressed as well but its scary to even think what these children have went through or are going through that brought them to this horrendous place. I hate calling the sadness that I went through ""depression"" because that word just triggers me to think of everything that is wrong with me. I coped through my sad times by turning to religion but I know not everyone is like me. I dont even know how to help these kids and I dont think stuffing them with drugs prescribed by the doctor will ever help. It hurts me everyday to see them because I wish I had the power to rewire their brains and make them see the goodness in life. 
Life is a constant struggle and is not a place I like either, but that doesnt mean you should just quit. You need to keep going. You need to find one thing and try to get to it. Just one goal. It is hard when you wake up and you dont even want to get up, just starting your day by wishing you died in your sleep, but trust me, one day you will like something about life. And you will die in the end which may make it seem like you are just living for no end goal or purpose, but I believe I am not working for this world but the afterlife, and even if you dont believe in this, just try to make it your goal to make others lives better and make others happy before you die. No amount of money will ever make you happy if your not happy with yourself. So push yourself and cry and keep going. Sacrifice yourself for others and dont expect nothing in return. The smile you give to others by tearing yourself apart will give you comfort, and hopefully make you smile one day. And if it doesnt...i might come visit you and make you smile 😊",not depression

"00:00 zero o clock : I’ve been listening to the new BTS album and usually it takes me a long while til I look up the English translation. When I do though, it’s always relevant to how I’m feeling. They really do write uplifting lyrics. Nothing overly bearing and cheesy. Take a look at this first verse: 
You know those days
Those days where you're sad for no reason
Those days where your body is heavy
And it looks like everyone else except you is busy and fierce
My feet won't set off, though it seems like I'm already too late
I'm hateful of the whole world
Isn’t all of this relatable? A constant feeling of sadness, some known reasons, some unknown. And as I live day by day, these feelings linger and life just feels pointless. Next verse: 
Come home and lie in bed
Thinking if it was my fault?
Dizzy night, looking at the clock
Soon it will be midnight
Will something be different?
It won't be something like that
But this day will be over
When the minute and second hands overlap
The world holds its breath for a little while
Zero o’clock
Life feels pointless and I could say I’m hopeless but apart of me always says “tomorrow” “tomorrow will be better” “I will start ____ tomorrow”. It’s all a little white lie but a glimmer of hope for myself to continue is good enough for me. Anyway this song makes me feel like it’s okay to feel the way I feel. Tomorrow is a new day and I can try again. These feelings aren’t going to disappear within a night. Anyway I do suggest listening to their music. My favorite song is paradise which is along the same premise: it’s ok not to have a dream or force myself to have this extravagant hopefulness/ dream like others. It’s okay to live day by day and conquer little things in life.

"I am once again asking for your help : None of the cookie cutter shit, please. I appreciate it but I would strongly prefer answers that will help me get closer to the subject matter.
I've been researching this on and off for months. It seems to be, at least in the US/UK, strictly limited to the (physically) terminally ill - assisted suicide, that is. Euthanasia is illegal here in the US, period. I'm from the upper east coast and have no such options, am in average to below average physical health, but have lived with lifelong depression among other things. I would like to pass with some dignity rather than miserably clinging onto something I consider meaningless. I literally only live because it would emotionally inconvenience my immediate family and friends. I'd prefer to leave the most shallow emotional scar I possibly can and to leave my physical imprint similarly shallow (my personal belongings being packaged up/easy to dispose of or store, etc.).
If there are no options in the US I am considering overseas options, even if that requires I become a citizen. In the Netherlands or Switzerland it is a 5-year or so process, which in hindsight is nothing to fret about. The grind and dedication to achieve the means to the end is comforting enough.
Ultimately I'd like to make as little a mess as possible as a hanging death via doorknob and a drug cocktail is nothing I would like to leave anyone cleaning up. If it becomes my only option then very well, but I'd like to go with dignity and at least leave my loved ones better prepared.",not depression

"The change that brought me out of depression. [long, hopefully inspiring] : I was a good college student, but overwhelmed because of the intensity of the material I studied. As graduation approached, I managed to land a job (not degree related) that paid pretty well coming out of school. I thought I was set. 
Then the work began, the job wasn’t horrible, but it was stressful and exhaustive. the days were long...10-12 hour days, Monday through Friday. 
After a year I realized I’m spending most of my time at work, and doing very little outside of it. Stopped going to the gym, starting eating like shit, hardly ever saw my friends, hell I hardly had friends to begin with. You know what, scratch that, I DIDN’T realize it at the time, but that’s what was happening and that’s how it always fucking begins...you let that life giving force slip away from you unnoticed. 
Anyway, I started applying elsewhere within the same industry. My thinking was, I’ll give this industry another shot and if it’s the same BS, I’m out, I’ll do something else entirely ...what that was at the time, I didn’t know, I didn’t really have a long term plan. 
I landed another job, more money, similar title, same exhaustive hours, different company, in a Big city, which prompted me to move out which was exciting. Everything was new and that new energy powered me through the first new year on the job. 
And then the lack of realization struck again, i was being groomed for a life time of suffering. At the time, what I DID realize is that This is just how life goes...you graduate and then work yourself half to death. I was putting in so much work and neglecting myself entirely. The job was great at masking my neglect. They’d have work parties, music playing, TVs everywhere playing the news, sports, etc. food was provided, we had a bar, mini golf, pool tables, the works. The idea was that you go to work and you shouldn’t feel like you’re there, which was a great concept...but still, I had no life. This company bought my life. 
I became a shell, I’d come home, pound 3-4 beers and surf the couch til bed time. I was irritable, annoyed and lazy, depressed. Once the weekend came...I was dead to the world. Friday I was too tired to go out, Saturday was my only day to catch up on anything at all, and Sunday ...Sunday...man, that was the day that never failed to remind me that...hey your life sucks. Sunday was the day of dread, I didn’t want to do anything because I knew that the next day, my suffering resumed. I became depressed. So so depressed. 
I continued this for two years, I burned out. I was a drone. I lived to work and nothing else. I lost. I felt useless, worthless, watching life zoom by. I became out of shape, unhealthy, lazy, mean, sad. 
Then one day, at a family party on a Sunday, I left early and on the drive home I found the courage to change it all. I said to myself “I want out, I want change” not just any change, positive change. Nobody should have to live this way. 
The next day I showed up at work and put in the utmost minimal amount of work possible, all the while applying for any and every other possible job out there. It was then that I reconnected with a former college friend who seemed to have a great job in an industry suited to my degree. She said she’d put in a word for me and that was that. 
Within two months, my life changed so dramatically, I cried tears of happiness. The job is awesome, caters to work/life balance, and it’s just good. I have my life back, I’m healthy again, in the best shape of my life, doing the things I want to do. The only downside was that I took a 22% salary cut to do this, but in the two years I’ve been here I’ve made up for more than half of that already. Besides, I learned that no amount of money can buy my happiness. I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been making less than my previous two jobs. I’m still here, thriving, happy and looking forward to the future. 
My example is obviously very specific but here is what you should take away from this:
Take a step back and observe your life, there is something there that doesn’t belong and hone in on it, change it. It can be something small or something as big as changing careers and flipping your life upside down temporarily. Things get tougher before they get better, but we’re humans and we’re capable of suffering. If you’re suffering now, you can take a little more if the result brings about positive change. It’s fucking scary, but nothing will change if you don’t try. We deserve the best, but the best starts with respecting yourself and changing the life around you.
Best of luck. You got this.",not depression

"I can't talk to my friends or family and I really need to let some stuff out. : A while ago I realized how much I dislike every aspect of my life.  Everything in my life that is supposed to bring me happiness is majorly flawed.  I'm not going to get into every single aspect, just the main ones that have been paining my lately. Every one of my friendships has a major key missing. Dont get me wrong, I love my friends, and I would do anything for them.  But it has been years since I've felt true love and happiness around anybody.  Most of the time I am around someone I want to be home.  Something is missing in every friendship.  Every.  Single.  Friendship.  It's different for everyone and I wont get into it for every specific person but it fucks me up.  I want to feel comfortable and happy with someone.  Truly comfortable and happy.  Like wanting to spend hours with them, feeling heard and understood, feeling the way it feels when your love is reciprocated fully.  And this is why I cant talk to my friends about this.  I cant hurt them.  I cant tell them that I think our friendship is flawed or that I dont really feel at home with them.  Thats horrible.  But sometimes I think they can feel it.  And it sucks even more.  I talk to them and I can see it in their eyes.  They can see I'm not totally happy being with them and it hurts them.  And it hurts me to know I make them feel that way.  It's an endless cycle.  like I said, it's been years since I've felt fully platonically in love with a friend. And  I feel so disconnected from my family.  I'm the odd one out.  It's like I got put into my own personal hell.  I am nothing like these people.  And I'm stuck with them for years to come.  You're supposed to feel loved and supported and happy with your family.  They've broken my heart so many times.  I've just learned to keep to myself. It hurts not even get along with your family.  It hurts so bad.  I know the next 5 years of my life are going to be so lonely, sad, and stressful.  I might not make it.  My heart has been broken, and I mean I can feel the pain in my heart, so many times.  By my friends, by my family, by people i have been romantically interested in.  I dont know how it hasnt just died.  I know that sounds dramatic, but it has felt so much pain.  And to top it all off, I lost the one person who I felt slightly connected to.  Still off by a long shot, but closer than anyone I've ever known.  She turned into someone I couldnt stand to be around, and it hurt.  It still hurts.  I had to distance myself.  Everytime Ive spoken to her in the last year i hope for someone who isnt there, and it breaks my heart every time.  She became mean and vindictive and selfish.  Now I feel truly alone. I hate to feel this way so young.  I honestly wish I could just end it all.  I am a realist, and I just wish people would let me do it. I know the next 5 years, and possibly the rest of my life are going to be a sad waste.  I wish people would put their emotion aside and let me do it.  It would save me and everyone else so much heartache.  I wish I could get cancer. People cope easier with it, or at least better than a sudden abrupt death.  They wont have to wonder why I did it, they'll know it was the cancer, and that's good enough for me.  I really believe it's the best option, all emotions aside.  I wish I could get into everything, I wish I could talk to someone and let everything that is in my head out, but I cant.  It all boils down to one thing.  I truly believe I am not meant for this life.",not depression

I'm just so  tired, i live in a third world country, i'm poor, my house and family are falling apart, and my mental issues are getting worst and worst because of the situations. I can't have a job because i'm underage, i'm struggling with that, sometimes i take care of my sick grandma and my uncles pay me, but it's not enough, my mom doesn't want to take care of me anymore even when i swear that i will get a job as soon i turn 18. 
My vacations just ended, i came home, my mom and dad were figthing because she just realized how bad we live, and so i did, our house is a mess, the walls are falling, when it rains the water enters the house, etc. It's not big deal for me because i'm used to live like this, but everytime i'm long gone from here and i come back, i just can't believe that we live like this. 
 My mom started to scream and insult my father, and even if she was right, it's traumatic to hear them figthing, it makes me feel horrible because i know My father is making everything bad. This is always happening, it's scary. 
 I feel awful, i don't want her to live like this after all she did for this house, i want to help her, she works every day with no rest, my dad can't have a job. 
I just can't take this anymore, the struggle of being poor, having a family that it's NEVER going to be well, and they never let you feel well, feeling shitty because i hate myself. I hate this. I just can't, i can't live like this anymore and the worst part is that i have to keep waiting because of my age. I tried to be happy, to ignore this, but day by day it keeps getting worst.
My only hope is that i will be out of here soon, one way or another. I wish i could help them, it hurts so much watching how everything turns worst and worst and you just can't make a difference, not in your life, and not in the life of them. 
The only thing that brings me some joy it's knowing that i will move in two years, because i will work very hard. I just want to be out of here, i can't live like this. I have no motivation, everyday is grey, empty, because this eats me inside. And i can't stop crying because sometimes i feel like this is so unfair, i'm tired of being tired, to not find a way to be happy, everything it's so hard, i choose it or not.

"50% genetic, 40% lifestyle , 10% circumstance : If you believe in the science/ stats, then you know that what you’re going through isn’t permanent. 40% of your happiness is affected by choices and decisions in your life that YOU CAN INFLUENCE. 
A lot of people on this thread constantly ruminating on the bad times. If you wanna get better you need to get some serious positive influences in your life and make quantitative changes. Imagine thinking you’re gonna fix your depression by listening to the thoughts and ideas of other depressed people. It makes no sense right? Here’s some serious scientific-based advice from a psychology student.
Top five tips to getting better; 
1. Exercise, sleep, and diet. Not going to go into it all. But fucking do it. Not going to debate which diet is the healthiest either, but low sugar is a good place to start for all those soft drink enthusiasts.
2. Socialise. Find people whose company you enjoy and click with. Cling to those people (not in a weird way). Foster those relationships. Friendships are hard, you need to put effort into them if you want them to work. That means messaging on a daily basis, organising weekly meetups, listening to them when they are struggling (and in turn them listening to you). If you have any antisocial addictions, make them social! Hard core gamers, get all over discord. Alcoholics, attend AA meetings (PLURAL). You get the drift. 
3. Don’t limit yourself in what you can and can’t do due to the judgments of others (parents, friends, etc). Helplessness and lack of control is a depression complex on its own. Go get your motorbike license, or get that sick tattoo, or cross dress on a night out. Idc just go do it because you’ll hate yourself for not. 
4. Routine. Get yourself a routine. I cannot stress this enough. Getting out of bed is the hardest part of the day for some people. On my worst days, I’ll make sure more than anything to brush my teeth. From there on out everything just flows. Shower-&gt; breakfast -&gt; Car -&gt; Work/Uni etc... I won’t get into the psychology of it because it’s extremely broad and long winded, I could do a whole ten thousand word thesis on it.(I couldn’t but someone could, it’s that extensive).
5. Start a diary. Essential. Log your thoughts and emotions and how you responded to them. Was it healthy? We’re you right in thinking / feeling that way? Depression is a very emotional state of being and a diary is a really productive way to rationalise all these intense thoughts and emotions running around in your head. Putting them down on paper also helps you talk about them later which is a really positive and healthy way of dealing with it all.
So, five tips that you can start implementing into your life right now! If you start doing these things and don’t see improvement, you’re just as much of a statistical anomaly as Helen Keller. Gl have fun and let me know how it all goes.",not depression
"overflowing with pain how do i stop even when ive come to a conclusion RANT : the other day i went to a family reunion which is usually something i look forward to as it is all fun and games during those times. One big part of my depression and stress is family and mainly my elder sister (three sisters, eldest sister is very supportive of me, and i am the youngest child) we got in a stupid little argument where she ended up raising her voice at me, and idk i never cry over stuff like that but i think everyhing ive carefully stacked on top of eachother finally came crashing down all at once. I didnt want to cry in front of all my cousins (who i love) so i walked to another room where my eldest sister was trying to take a nap. I dont know what i would have done if this hadnt been seperated like that and i think i am very lucky. I ended up sobbing in the dark for an hour while we talked about everyhting that has gone down and it was the most genuine conversation and i definitely needed it. and then my other sister had walked in only to yell at me more for being inconsiderate. We then all talked as siblings and i couldnt even speak for myself as i couldnt talk over my tears. She then said she wasnt grateful or something and said she wished she grew up with different friends, in a different house, and a different face. Honestly i think she is the pretty sister and it rly hurt and annoyed me when she had said that because i always felt below her and everyone looked at her cuz she was prettier. And saying she basically wasnt grateful for what we had which is one of the only things i live for, really pushed me over. We both appologized but it didnt feel genuine and thinking about it makes me teary eyed because the sense of over loading frustration just tipping over is utterly the worst. Even when we had came to a conclusion i can tell nothing has changed. I am super grateful for my eldest sister who prolly has had it the hardest with our parents and being the oldest, and i also feel helpess for bot being able to help her",not depression

"Dear Younger Me : Dear younger me,
Looking back at your short existence and remembering the aspirations you had, hurts my heart to this day. When you dreamt of being a Marine, you watched on TV of the Americans fighting and said “I should be there to help them”, when you dreamt of being a Police Officer you were being bullied and tormented, when you dreamt of being a Paramedic you saw horrible car accidents and mass shootings. This life you’ve lived through you’ve seen and witnessed horrible things and all you wanted to do was help. At the end of the day you would have never guessed that your future self fucked everything up by taking a drag of blunt. I sit in our room and remember the times we’ve curled under covers crying ourselves to sleep at night listening to our parents scream at each other and hearing horrible words and glass, walls and dressers breaking. As we’d lay there we silently screamed to ourselves that one day we would make it out of here and never look back once we left the front door. When you were little I remember when you’d play Army with your buddies on the school playground with the mindset of you actually doing it once day, when your buddies would get hurt you’d be the first on the scene trying to gather information about what happened and helping them to their feet and to the school nurse. But older you fucked it up... by taking a long drag of a blunt. The blunt doesn’t taste to good now. I doubt in your naive young, smart and imaginative mind, that you, us, ourself, would be sitting on the edge of the bed sobbing into a pillow with a gun in your hand, the hammer cocked back and having it aimed to your head. Life wasn’t and isn’t easy, the hope for optimism died as soon as you got the call that you failed your urinalysis at the MEP Station. I’m sorry I crushed your hopes, aspirations and dreams. 
Sincerely yours- Your 19 year old self

"Loud Noises : I feel like for the first 22 years of my life I was sitting in the back seat of a car that I had set to autopilot. Someone times my car ran out of fuel and I felt stranded and I had people around me offer rides. Those were probably the best times of my life. Sitting shotgun in someone else’s car while they drove was so nice, but I feel like while I was in other people’s cars there was so much noise that no one could hear me. So, I stopped trying to listen. I stopped trying. 
Its hard to hear through the noise of life but occasionally I hear brief calls from whoever’s car I am in at the time. Those noises are scary because they are unfamiliar. Often when I hear one of those noises, I'd jump out of the car that I was in. I think I have been jumping out of other people’s cars so often I don’t even know where my own car is anymore. 
Now when people ask me to get into their cars, I can barely hear them anymore. The noises of life have gotten too much. All I want is to get into someone’s car and have them take me to mine. But I don’t even know how to make my own voice heard anymore. Now, whenever someone stops to let me in and ask me where I am going, the only way I know how to have my voice be heard is to shout over the noises of life. And when I shout at someone trying to help me, they drive away. Or maybe I run away. Why are the noises so loud?",not depression

"What books would you recommend for a depressed person in his/her early 20’s? : Hey redditors, I really need help so I’d appreciate if you would read my post and maybe change my life to help me see the light again. I have seen a lot of posts and advices on good books but I’d like to read a few books more specific for a guy my age, books to change my perspective on life and to feel happy again. 
Just a little background: I’m a 22 year old guy who has suffered a lot lately. I had a decent relationship with a girl who is perfect in everyones eyes: Loving, loyal, beautiful, smart, studying &amp; working hard to guarantee ourselves a bright future. The problem was that she was literally too good and respectful for me and I didn’t love her enough for some reasons. I’m still trying to figure those reasons. We decided to break up because I didn’t see her as the mother of my children. I cheated on her twice (kissing a different girl) and I know I would never do that when I was together with someone I love truly. Not trying to justify the cheating, because I know that’s completely wrong and we both suffered from it. After the second time I knew I didn’t love her enough. 
Anyways, we broke up half a year ago and since then everything has going downhill for me. I did good in school, had a good life and was happy until then. After her, I was in pain because I knew I would never have someone like het ever again, but once again, I just didn’t see a future with her even though she is perfect in any way possible. I just need someone who is less polite and who wouldn’t be afraid to have a discussion with me when I’m wrong. I know that seems really weird to hear, but it is what it is. I became an addict, used to do XTC once a year at a festival but in september I bought a lot at once, just to feel happiness again. I discovered cocaine and ketamine and became addicted. I am doing way less now than before but still too much. I used to take pills in bed just to feel happy during the night. Sometimes 6 pieces a night. Been to the doctor and a psychologist and they are now helping me to do less and eventually never again. My parents know nothing about me doing drugs and I want to keep it that way, my friends do know though and they are concerned. 
The relationship with my mother has been unstable for a few years. It is better now but we still fight a lot, also because she is really depressed and that is hard to deal with. The relationship with my dad is perfect though. They’re both single. Relationship with my siblings (kids of my mom, different dad) is pretty good too. I used to text a different girl but when I fell in love she stopped responding and that’s why I have been feeling bad for the past few days.
I have good days, but sometimes, like today, I feel useless. I hate thinking about having to work whole my life to then spend your money when you’re - in my opinion - too old. (here you can reture when you are 67, probably 70 when it’s my time to retire.) I just have a feeling that this life is not for me and I want to know the meaning of life. In my eyes we live to work and then die, if that’s what life is, I don’t want to live that life. But no, I would never commit suicide if that’s what you’re thinking.
But I know there is way more than that, I just have a wrong perception of life and I want it to change. I’ve been watching a lot of motivational speakers lately and I’ve read a lot about books changing the life of many people. (The subtle art of not giving a f*ck, meditations,...). It really has an impact on me and I know there are reasons to live and ways to be happy.
I really want to feel happy again, find reasons to live this life and just be positive in life, having the ability to control (and maybe even turn off) my emotions in stead of letting them take control over me. If you read until here, I am very thankful, you are a good person for willing to help someone in need. 
Now, what books do you people recommend to find the meaning of life, to be positive again, to gain control over your emotions and just to be happy again. I am desperate for good books and I know they will help me become a positive person. Any recommendation is fine, I just want to feel happy again, forever. 
Thank you very much for reading &amp; have a good day :)",not depression

I tricked a girl into loving me for three years, until she finally wise up and told me to get lost. I lost my friend group from high school, and haven't managed to keep a friend for over a year since then. I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a very likable person, and that knowledge, plus my loneliness cause me to become more bitter, and less likable which perpetuates the cycle. I just feel like I was never really meant to exist, like life has slots for gears, and I'm just a disc, so I could never get any traction. I guess it makes sense?

"I sensed my subconscious yesterday. : I was listening to a Tricky song, Hot Like A Sauna, and *immediately* broke out into tears. Took me a second but I was able to connect it to my ex - that was ""our"" album. I guess it still hurts.
I decided to switch to a song that had nothing to do with her. That ended up being Cradle Of Filth - From the Cradle to Enslave. 
Now, when I started the song on Spotify, I ...felt/sensed/noticed this... gods, how do I say this... it was like an external set of ...eyes, looking down into my mind/memories/past and trying to connect the song to something related to my ex.
It felt like a web-crawler. An automated computer program that was 100%, completely and totally untouchable in *any* way conceivable. I could not ""see"" it, I could not talk to it, I could not rationalize it. It was something that felt alien but had to be me. It was going through **rapid fire** ...I hesitate to call them memories but it was like that - images, scenes, memories - but they happened SO fast that I have no memory of them at all. I was able to sense them in a way and that's how I knew they were all tangental to my ex in a weird way.
I am 100% convinced I somehow witnessed my own subconcsious at work trying to either defend or punish me. When I think about it all rationality kinda leaves the scene. There is no sense to be made of it. I could *feel* it working.

"Introduction to me here : 19 male in tampa, florida, my name is Lucas. Recently been pretty depressed and also have Hashimotos thyroid autoimmune disease. Just wanna say that a solution to depression can be supplements and diet, allot of times it's not just something you can talk yourself out of, almost physical or chemical. 
- Vitamin Adk with fatty meal 
- used to take a B Complex
- used to also take Magnesium Citrate
Life is short and confusing for us who have depression. Decide if you wanna climb out of the depression with experimenting with psychedelics, exercise, etc. 
I am very confused as to what I should do with myself but no one can experiment for you. 
This whole thread also kinda encourages depression by reading about it but i do like to read these posts.",not depression
"Feeling useless : I’m not a very outspoken or opinionated person usually but if I have experience with something or know the answer to someone’s question I’ll speak up. Over and over though, I get shut down or just flat out ignored. It happens so often but for some reason it still hurts me. My opinion is not valued and any information I have is doubted by everyone. I feel dumb, unappreciated, useless, and depressed as a result. It’s taken 33 years but I think I finally have to just stay quiet and not attempt to help people anymore. That’s sad in itself.

"Incredibly alone : Apologize first for any grammatical or punctuation errors. And alot of this is going to come of as rambling.
A little bit about myself. I'm 29 years old male and recently had to find a place with some roomates. They're busy alot so they cant really hangout. I work at a crappy dead end job and dont have any ambition to find another, plus if I quit I would most likely lose the outlet I have to talk to the few people I do and without that I dont know what I would do. 
I am alone and have been most of my life. I've  always struggled to make friends and was bullied alot as a kid. I assumed that's how people treated you so I got used to it. I've never been on a date or had a girlfriend. I don't know what it is about me that people find off putting. I try to be a good listener. I am overweight but I take care of myself. I make sure my hair is fixed my clothes are neat and clean and that I always smell nice. I make an effort to appear presentable. Outwardly I dont think people would know how lonely I am and how everyday I feel like a failure in everything I do. 
I try to be a good person and make time for people.  I'm friendly and try to be helpful and show people I care but all I get is rejection. I have maybe one friend but hes busy alot and dealing with his own stuff and I don't want to push him away by being needy. I don't think most people are bad or have bad will towards other people. I used to think people were terrible but as I've matured I've found it's not always black and white. I think people can be jerks and self centered sometimes but I think for the most part most people are okay.  So I havent given up on people yet. It just feels like nobody wants me. I think people like me well enough just not enough to be my friend or something more. 
I've always had terrible luck with woman. I'm good at talking to them and listening but I can't ever seem to move past that into something romantic. I don't blame them because sometimes I take a step back from myself and I think who would want this. 
 I've been told I am a nice guy I just wish I had someone I could show. I am so tired of being alone. I  didnt ask to be alone. I dont want to be alone and I tried to make friends and seek romance but all I get is rejection.  The only think keeping me going is the hope that tomorrow will be better but everyday that gets harder and harder to believe.  
I feel like I must have some major flaw that I can't see and I just wish someone would tell me what it is so I could fix it. 
Again I apologize for the rambling. I'm just in a really bad place right now. I just wan someone to talk to.",not depression
"I dunno wtf to title this lol : I'm really not good right now. I feel like I'm only staying alive so that I don't annoy other people or make their life inconvenient by me dying. I just feel so trapped and like what's the point ya know. Like I don't even stay alive for me anymore, but what I truly want is to be dead. And I don't know how to change that desire. I already feel like an inconvenience and killing myself would only prove that. Why is it that the people who come back from their depression and do meaningful things with their lives are seen as the heroes. What about the people who never find their way out. Maybe they're just being true to themselves by committing suicide, maybe it's okay for them to leave, because that's what they truly desire and they have been living in hell on earth. And maybe it takes bravery to end their life with all the pressure from everyone else to just keep going. I'm sick of just staying here for everyone else, can I just do something for me once? Something that I actually want? If people truly loved me wouldn't they want my suffering to end, whatever the cost, even if it inconvenienced them? I dunno. I just don't fucking care anymore. I feel like Logan in his last movie.

I wanted to cut myself because the emotional pain is too much that I wish it was physical pain. I haven’t been sleeping well ever since the night I found out, I lost my appetite even more, and I’ve been cold. There’s so many things popping out of my mind like what did I do wrong to deserve this? Why the hell did he do this me? Am I even worth it? Am I just some sort of play thing that you get to toy with then just throw away? I wanted answers to my questions and my mind just won’t shut up. I couldn’t even see myself smiling or laughing anymore. I don’t even want to go outside; I just lock myself in my room and stay in bed all day.

"I feel like my dream of meeting the love of my life is slipping away from me.....:( : I turned 24 last October. I have never had a real boyfriend and I am still a virgin. Hell, I have never even held hands with a guy or french kissed anyone and guys don’t seem to find me appealing/attractive.....:( I am currently talking to someone right now but I am not sure if that is going to work out. I am becoming extremely anxious getting and petrified of the thought that I will never meet the love of my life and get married. The thought of never being able to know the joys of having a man return my affections and being single for the rest of my......it’s so unbearable and frightening to the point that I can’t even think about it without choking up.
I know it might sound pathetic but let me tell a certain story to put things in perspective:
I have a friend who is an aspiring artist. She is super super talented at what she does and she has pretty much dedicated her whole life to perfecting her art skills since she was in grade school. She practices everyday, does freelance artwork, and has even attended an art college. She has recently made accounts on every social media app known to man in order to promote her art and makes sure to post consistently as possible. Therefore, I am sure she would have a MAJOR MAJOR mental breakdown if God himself came down and told her the following: “Sorry but you’re graphic novels are never gonna get published and you’re not be a game designer. Hell, you’ll be lucky if any of your social media accounts get more 
than 500 followers.” I know that make her feel as if her heart would rip out of her chest and it 
would crush every part of her soul.
That is exactly how important my dream of finding love is to me and as I get older.....I feel like that dream is slipping more and more away from me.

"I don’t like who I’m becoming : So just a bit of context.
So I’m a third year university student and last December I had to have surgery on my lower back. It was a pretty big surgery so I missed around 1 month of school to recover. But during those weeks I was alone pretty much everyday and stuck in bed all day because I couldn’t move properly. The best part of my day was seeing the nurses and doctors for post surgery care because I could finally talk to someone, someone who cared. It was the most loneliest time in my life because most of my friends were busy with finals and I was just alone with my thoughts. So I started over analyzing a lot of things and hate myself for missing classes and finals. I know that what happen was out of my control but I keep feeling like this was punishment for something I did. 
When I came back to school for the next semester I realized a lot of people didn’t even realize that I missed a month of school. And these are people that I’ve know for two years, we all know each other in my program because there’s only 60 of us. I feel like if people don’t notice that I’m gone for a month, they never really cared about me at all. My friends told me that everyone was just busy with finals so no one was really paying attention to anything but themselves. But I still feel like no one cares about me and I dealing with everything on my own. After that I started to notice that I genuinely hate everyone. I hate seeing other people laughing and smiling with other people. I deserve to be happy too. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends because I realized that they only ever talked to me if they needed anything. I tried talking to one of my friends about my whole situation and she said I was just being dramatic. I stopped talking to her about myself after that.
But now I’m starting to realize that I’m changing. I will spend the entire day without saying a word or talk to anyone. I hate seeing other people be happy. I want them to be in the same situation as me. I keep looking at people and hoping something bad happens to them. I never thought like before. I started drinking before I go to bed because I can’t sleep anymore. I used to love my program and going to school. But now when ever I hate even entering the building and see people in my program. I stopped caring about things. I don’t care about school, or my life or about me. I have no motivation at all do anything. I used to have my life together and now everything is a mess.
I don’t like who I am right know. I really want to go back to who I was. But I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

I wish I could tell you about my best friend, and his struggles and how they've affected me and how he's hurt me but I can't.
I don't know if I'll get better. I'd like to think that I will but I don't know.

"An introverted college student’s ramblings and cry for help : (This is my first time ever posting in reddit, so I apologize in advice for any weirdness. This may come off as more of a rant if I’m not careful.)
I’ve started college recently and its nothing like I expected it to be, I’ve only been here for less than two semesters and I feel absolutely alienated here. I have no friends still and I feel like such a stranger and that I don’t belong here. Now I’ve always been an extreme introvert, the majority of my social interactions coming from games such as World of Warcraft. Recently I had quit WoW due to my failing grades (which I will get to) and now I feel like my only lifeline to people has been cut off. It’s not that I don’t like people, I just have no idea how to approach them. This compounded with my miserable GPA of my first semester has put me into a huge rut of depression that is actually scary. 
I genuinely feel nauseous at times and the loneliness has been having an effect on my psyche. Not to mention my grades slipping due to the simple fact of not having as my dad would put it “fire in my heart.” I live alone with him and I am genuinely grateful I am able to depend on him, but I don’t want to worry him about these feelings of depression and like a layer of weight is always on me. The thing is, I used to have that fire, and now I feel so empty without any passion. To put it simply, I feel hopeless, I used to be the master of studying and school. I was almost valedictorian and passed my classes with ease, including honors classes. Now, I feel like an absolute idiot, I can’t absorb anything I study, and I feel low all the time now. It’s begun to affect my dad and my dog, I’ve stopped going on walks with my dog, and my dad keeps asking me if I’m okay. And to be honest, I don’t know if I am.
Now I haven’t thought of anything drastic, like harming myself, but I do just wish I could sleep all day and desire so much to regain my social outlet of WoW again. But I know that won’t help, I’m honestly at loss at what I should do and any advice would be appreciated, whether it be college or social related, or even just what I could possibly do to regain my excitement for life I used to have or whatever, I’m at a loss for what I even need or want right now.

"I may have been abused and I'm so angry : My father may have abused me. I guess it was abuse, im not sure. 
I just have intense memories. These images in my head that i can't get rid of. 
Thing is, im pretty sure I was a difficult kid. I would get into fights with him a lot of times. Like once when i was really young i threw a rock at my sister and made her bleed. He yelled at me for a while and kept pushing me against the wall and knocking me down. ""You could have killed her!"" He said that. I still remember it.
Now i hardly ever get in fights with him. I just fight with my mom now.
Another time when i was maybe 14 my brother was annoying me and as i poured syrup on my waffles i told him, ""did you know you have to stab somebody a lot of times for them to die? People think its only once but its actually a lot."" Something like that. My dad was in the room.
The next thing i knew he whisked me away to the garage.
I was there for over an hour. He yelled at me a bunch of times and threatened to have me comitted to an institution. We had a bunch of bikes in the garage that he kept pushing me against. I kept knocking them over. At one point he grabbed me around the neck and said, ""I'll kill you,"" through gritted teeth. He was mad, I think because he thought I'd actually try to stab my brother. He kept threatening me, saying what hed do to me if I tried to do anything to ""his family.""
So as you can see i was a difficult kid. I did/said things that were fucked up sometimes. I feel like, in a way, i deserved what happened to me in the garage. Though the fact that it still haunts me at age 20 makes me think it might have been a not quite normal reaction on his part.
I have other memories: once he sat on my head on the sidewalk once. Or another time when he called me a goddamn dumbass, or when he called me a pussy. Or all those times he used to lock me outside.
Mostly i just remember how his face looned when he'd get like that: his pipils tiny, his mouth bared into a growl. His veins kinda popping out, his hair askew. Its a very familiar image to me. 
Thing is this post makes him seem like some kind of monster though, and hes really not. Sometimes he seems like a sad old man to me. Other times he seems like a banal asshole, hardly worth my time. And i no he got hit a lot when he was a kid, way worse than i ever was. He always told me how lenient he was with me compared to how his father would have been. His grandfather was even worse. Apparently once his grandfather didnt like how his father reached across the table during dinner, so he stabbed his hand with a fork. So in a way, im lucky.
But other times i am so angry. I think about killing him. Ever since I was a kid i have fantasized about killing him, or at least breaking his shins with a hammer. 
Sometimes i get so angry that I wish I could kill everyone. Or better yet, myself. I dont know. I just wish I could make this all go away. 
And im still financially dependent on him. And i probably will be for much longer.

"Not able to love... : So i have been in a relationship for about 1,5 years now, at first it was all ""pink love Vision"" but qt some point i keept overwhelming my partner, She said i made her insecure about her work and her self esteem by always taking Note of her little misstakes and misshaps... Wich was dumb. See... Im an only child, i have Problems socialising, my parents told me when i was little they went to the doctor with me who told them im some Kind of ""special""(maybe Asbergers, but i dont want to know...) but they declined the treatment/Support because i dont fucking know. This is my longest relationship up to this point... And it Evolved into me hating to to open my eyes in the morning and crying when i have the spare time.... You see over time She grew more sick of her work and of me.... Her Co workers seemed to get her demotivated, i only seem to make it Worse because i cant relate to her situation (i work in a carshop/Workshop... Im used to rough Tones, She was working as an electrician) and then in december it happend.... She just stopped going to work, got fired and now doesn't have a Job... Seems like she already gave up.... She is growing sick of me and everything by the Minute, i cant take it anymore... Tell me do i just give up?! Its like everything i know is wrong...

"I am a joke : My entire life didn't go the way it was supposed to go. I will be 27 this year and I have no higher-level education, no driving license, still living with my mom and being financially dependant on her, my only job experience is when I worked 2 years as a janitor and I had sex one time in the span of 5 years. It would be 7 years but I went to a hooker when I was 22.
At the age of 13 when hitting puberty, I got a nasty blackhead rush in my penis due to poor hygiene and it's still there, after nearly 14 years I haven't dealt with that problem. I have a fungus infection on my chest and pubic area and I have slight gynecomastia so I look like I have manboobs even tho I am skinny. I had to shave my head because I am not even 27 yet but already balding and can't really have any proper haircut. My parents divorced when I was 11 and they both moved out so I was growing up with abusive grandparents that were treating me like a free physical laborer to do the job around the house and their garden. I can't connect emotionally with people because I don't know how to and because of that my longest relationship was merely 10 months long - because it was a long-distance relationship, normal ones don't last longer than 3 or 4 months.
My entire life is a chain of unfortunate events. I feel like a test subject selected by some crazy scientist to see how much one human can take and not kill himself. I am so tired of pretending everything is fine and trying to live my life, I just feel like I no longer can do that.
At the age of 24, I started a 1-year long course that prepared me for university. I applied and got accepted to uni at the age of 25 and currently, I am doing the 2nd semester of 2nd year. I went to a doctor and got some cream for the fungal infection and blackheads, but it's been 6 weeks of applying these and there is no visible effect yet.
A girl from my class that's only 19 years old was interested in me and I felt happy the first time for a very long time, but all it took was to have sex with me once. I was unable to make give her orgasm and who knows if she noticed my blackheads, probably yes. Afterward, she cut the contact and we are not speaking anymore. Now she is dating another guy from our class and I have to watch them being intimate and happy together every day during classes.
I tried to be more social and engaging with people, but I just don't click with anyone. I don't have social life and every time I try it just feels like I am invading or overstepping. I am just that weird stranger who sometimes has a small-talk with you. I have no one to talk to, I have no close friends and I feel like it's time to just end it all.
My life always was a miserable mess filled with sadness and disappointment, that's why I am thinking more and more intensely about ending it. What's the point? I remember when I was 20 and I was thinking that one time it will get better, ""Just wait and see how your life will look at the age of 25, you will probably have family on your own by then!"". Well, no. It's been only worse and worse and it feels like I will not finish university because of my declining mental state. I am falling behind with material and can no longer follow what's happening in the lectures due to a lack in knowledge from previous lectures.

"Post-College Depression : I’m 22 years old, graduated last August and came back to my country (I was awarded a full ride and got the chance to study abroad).

Not being able to find a job and adjusting to my old (but new) life again, have taken a toll on my mental health. I spend most of my days crying, barely eat, always feel tired, force myself to be social, and pretend I’m doing great on social media. I am not ok. The bag of expectations feels so heavy, I’m questioning myself most of the time, and feel so anxious. It’s hard to talk about this to others since I feel embarrassed about myself. My mom knows I’m struggling with my emotions but her only advice is “pray”. I applied for grad school and still feel I’m not good enough. I know I sound like a spoiled brat and people out there have it way worse than I do. I know this isn’t the end of the world, but it sometimes feel like it is. I can’t help my sadness and how anxious I feel all the time. I haven’t had a truly happy day in months. I’m trying, seriously trying my best to not feel sad but I know I’m failing.",not depression
"A letter to my best friend : Dear sister,
We were born in different families but fated to meet.
I was so shy back then, so afraid of the world and how everyone thought of me. I was bullied for my differences from the crowd. I hated life back then, between the bullying and the abuse back home.
And then like an angel, you appeared. You spoke to me as if I was human and showed me empathy. And although I never asked, you stood up for me and wiped away my tears.
You were so beautiful to me, like a goddess and like the best friend I could ever wish for. Of course you had your flaws, don't we all, but i adored you despite them.
You were always so intelligent and bright but stubborn and short tempered. 
I know at times you do not feel loved but do you really need a lover to realize just how loved you are? Just how special you are? You are incredible in so many ways.
What makes you special? Your big and loving heart. Its not easy to see past the cover of a book to see its real beauty..but you..you do that better than anyone I know.
I know life is hard and you're fighting a hidden war but you always were a fighter- a warrior.  Look at the battles you've faced and how much stronger you are because you never gave up. I've always been proud of you for that.
I know it is not much to offer but because i love you whole heartedly, you will always find a friend in me",not depression

"How do I forget : So a little about my story. I was engaged to this woman, I’ll call her KR. She was married then divorced after we got together. We were engaged to be wed after 2 years of a relationship, 4 months after engagement. She was very abusive physical and mental but She was the only thing ever on my mind. Idk why I ever let it go as far as it did. Maybe it was just love... or so I though it was. Day in and out..  long nights of work (railroad is a unforgiving career). She was the person I could open up to about anything, who I though was my best friend. We shared the good times, the bad, the sick and the sad together.  We were both introverts so we basically had each other then friends at work. We were not the big party type more of the party of 2 type so she was basically all I had, so you could say she was my best friend, as everyone who wants that bliss of a relationship. One night we were drinking together, having a great time playing games together and just having a great time when we started a serious conversation about our future...  this is where things go down hill and fast. We got to talking about what we would want and things we could see us doing in the future. I go on saying how I’d like to own a 1968 Dodge Charger and to be happily married and she went on too day she wanted to own a 70 Dodge Dart  and to finally have a successful marriage. We get to drinking some more and she lets it slip...  that she had cheated on me twice in the first 3 weeks of our relationship...  once with her ex husband and once again with a random hook up she had while in Vegas for some sort of convention she had for her current place of work. I stop dead in my tracks of doing anything... feeling my chest tighten up..  I was tired of how she would hit me or do horrible abusive things to me. I had got up and just walked out of the house and went to a friends house. Didn’t want to speak to KR or even see her... I mean for fucks sake if someone moves too fast in my general direction I flinch now I had no
Idea why would of happens if I had said something. I was raised to never lay a hand on a woman so I was defenseless...  I call off the next day of work and just call her and tell her I want all of her stuff out of the home I own. We get into a big argument, her saying oh it was so far in the past I should just forget about it. It’s done and over now why ruin something we have now.  “What a relationship built on lies?” I say to KR. I went through her fight for her kids, fight to keep her own stuff. Through thick and thin for that woman for her to say she cheated on me in the start...  after the big ending/fight we had she tells me I’m this and that and less of a man for leaving someone over something so little... yea. To her it was little...  But to the now..  I’m sitting here depressed as all hell. Drinking my sorrows and sadness away every night thinking to
My self, did I do the right thing...   still as it is 4 months later I ask my self should I of stayed with her...  I’m so lonely now and I don’t know what to do with my self on a daily basis. The tattoos and drinking only do so much for me..  lately it’s been getting through all the pain I put my self through. I feel just so alone and like I will never find anyone else. I want to look her up and tell her I’m sorry everyday but I can’t come to my senses to do it cause I know I’m not in the wrong here yet I feel sorry..  I don’t know what to do anymore beside drink my self to sleep every morning and maybe one of these dating sight will come through that I find the right one but it just does not feel like any of them actually work (beside matching with a damn bot).

No matter what I do that I’m pleased with, be it kinda cool, awesome, or just a little neat, is never acknowledged positively. If at all, it’s just a scoff and a “huh, I could do that, you’re not special” or something like that.

I would be more vocal, but I already have another friend who is pretty vocal, and I don’t really wanna steal her thunder there. Not saying we don’t support her, though, I just don’t wanna double the burden or make her feel unimportant in her problems.

"I don’t want to be a victim anymore : Context: I wrote this as a letter to myself weeks ago when I realized how much self-victimizing was preventing me from being happy. As I’m hitting another episode of deep, spiraling depression right now, I find myself empowered by my own words. I hope some of you find this letter helpful as well.
My mentality, for my entire life I feel like, has been plagued by me victimizing myself. I blow small situations out of proportion, I get in the way of what I want (many examples throughout my relationship with who I believe is the best boyfriend I’ve ever had), and I give my power of happiness to other people. I expect a certain level of comfort to be provided to me, and when it is not delivered, I become miserable, blaming others for treating me this way, or the universe for the way I am, for making me as traumatized of an individual as I am.
I need to stop.
Everything I’ve done, everything that has happened to me, is for me to take responsibility for. I need to stop being selfish and care about feeling good, or having someone else make me feel better. They’re not responsible for my happiness, my success, or my suffering. I am. I am not powerless. I decide what I want. And no one else need to get me or understand me for me to be happy. I do not need to please other people. I will do what I want to do, and say what I really want, instead of feeling powerless and continue to suffer. I also do not need make other people feel bad for the things I did to myself. I should ask for their intention, and respond by listening with intent. The perspective of my victim identity only adds to my suffering, and amplify the situation even more than what it is. 
I should not find fault with others, because that is why I end up dwelling on faults I find in myself. 
This victim mentality is not permanent, and it is not something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. This is something I can change, and the first step to it is recognizing that I have been acting like a victim. I am not powerless in this change, and I will remove that victim identity for myself.",not depression

"OCD and Depression : I have OCD and not depression (at least that's what I tell myself), though I guess the two are not mutually exclusive.   
It’s isolating sometimes, I think that is where the sadness comes from.  
Seeing friends is hard when there are nonsensical reasons that you can’t go out after work.  
Having hobbies can be hard when you can’t get out of the bathroom.  
Sleep is hard when the times you need to be in bed and out of bed don’t allow for it.  
Every time I get into a new hobby I am always worried, waiting for the moment I am going to have to leave it behind for some silly reason.  
I get scared about my intrusive thoughts, when they fixate on things like jumping off a building or walking in front of a car. I don’t want to do those things but I am forced to fixate on them, looping the thoughts over and over. It is desensitising.
Weirdly, the rest of my life is doing fine, my job is great and only getting better. Embracing my OCD helped me get where I needed to be. My partner is amazing and more than I could ever ask for. But I am petrified of the thoughts taking over and I lose myself to an off intrusion and end it all. I get angry at all my long term friends for being able to keep so close to one another while I sit in the shower again at home and dont talk to them for another two months. The worst part is I know the envy is silly.

"What is your favorite and least favorite part of the day? : Mornings are probably the worst part of the day for me, it's the time of the day when reality hits you and you feel a heaviness in your chest vowing to 'never leave the bed'. Of course you have to get out of bed, luckily for me I don't work so I have the time to eventually get up because I slowly start to feel better and being on the phone helps. Usually takes 1-2 hours.
Daytime goes by very quickly, lunch starts too quickly, never hungry and food tastes like dust so I have to force myself to eat, daytime is basically an attempt to outrun time and forcing yourself to look after yourself while all you want to do is stay in bed and play computer games or stare blankly into space. Daytimes are better than mornings though. 
Night-time is ok, the day is ending already but for night ours this is the time when our minds work the best and for some it's the only time when I feel functional so I stay up until after midnight because I don't want that feeling of being 'functional' to end. Don't want the morning to come back but eventually it will so we will have to submit to the impending morning. Night-times are my favourite time of the day though. Plus, going to sleep is nice in a way that it's kinda like letting go of the pressures of life, feel happier in my dreams as well, it's kinda nice and I suppose that makes it harder to stay awake in the mornings.",not depression

I was planning to give up life 4 years ago but then I met a woman and yes it was love at first sight 
She became the light in my clouded life and for the first time I truly felt I'm here for a reason ""HER""
Life went on and I forgot depression even existed in my life but then something happened 
Her parents asked her to get married (stupid fucking conservative life) she refused 
And that's when it all kicked in again 
Her mother said I'm not good enough for her but she always defies her and she loves me
But my ocd makes me believe I'm a horrible fucking person and it's been 3 years since my battle and I'm messed up badly
I wanna know if I'm truly a bad person or is it just in my mind? The ocd thoughts about being unworthy of her and a cheater are thoughts or there's more to it? 
I can't live life with guilt and without her I wanna end my life before I lose her",not depression

"I'm the most pro-active person that I know. (Growing up in a shithole rant). : I read, go to the gym, do a lot of cycling and cook myself healthy meals from scratch. Yet I've been depressed since I was a teenager(now 26).
I'm struggling to get work atm as my physical disability I was born with has simply gotten worse over the last couple of years and I'm no longer able to stand for extended time periods. I did everything that I was told I should, I learnt a trade whilst getting a degree (I'm the only person I know who has one). Yet through no fucking fault of my own I'm sat here alone as fuckin usual getting rejected from minimum wage jobs because I am either too qualified or in-experienced. 
I grew up in one of the worst areas in the UK(and have not long ago had to move back to my mums due to disability), all my friends have an addiction to either coke, weed or beer (Like every single fuckin one of them). Avoiding them is making me more depressed as I feel like a social outcast. 
Even if it wasn't for the drugs I dont wanna hang around with these complete utter tools. Most of them are racist af (I'm mixed race but one of the ""good ones""). One guy legit scoffed and went off on a homophobic rant all because I was listening to Craig David (true story). And another dude who legit cant even spell is still watching Alex Jones videos in 2020.
Honestly guys, I cant fuckin cope anymore. I'm surrounded by bitter fuckin idiots despite working my ass off for the last 10 years to get out of this place. I dont even feel as though I can consolidate with my family as they themselves are a bunch of violent moronic addicts. (Just for clarity between me, my mum, my dad my 2 uncles, auntie and their 4 kids above school leaving age we have a total of 21 GCSE's....me and my cousin got 10 each). 
It's just sooo fuckin hard trynna be good, especially when I'm skint as my areas known for a lot of organised crime in particular which a lot of my friends and family have been caught up (I wasn't exactly a saint myself growing up).
Sorry for the rant guys, but theres no one here that will listen and just typing this out has made me feel a little better.",not depression

"Today marks our 2 year anniversary, and 4 month and 5 day break-up. This lost love is showing me how doomed I am in life. : I'm the guy that keeps posting about lost love. 
I spent today at the cafe she and I went to 2 years ago. I was hoping she would come by, I was hoping she'd just want to have a peek at where I took her for the first time and for our first anniversary as a surprise. I visited where we met up as well, I was hoping she'd come. 
I guess no matter what, when I say I will unconditionally love, I meant it.... she didn't mean it. Today has been one of the hardest days of my life. While I am struggling here, she's probably having the time of her life somewhere else. After all, she did leave me knowingly and when I needed her. 
I don't know why I can't stop thinking of her. Every god damn day I think of her and its just etched into my mind with no sign of slowing down.  She did hurt me, and she hurt me real good. But I can't stop blaming myself for being a failure... her brother said so as well. I am a failure, I just mature slowly. I barely got to experience a teenage life, no rebelliousness, always doing what I am told. 
I see my friends buying houses and getting married.... I barely have 20K to my name. Even that is from saving and saving and saving. I struggle so much finding work, no matter where I go I get rejected... Either I am too qualified or not qualified enough. I'm just so demotivated from doing this shit over and over again to no avail. 
I am also enough of an asshole that I keep blaming my parents for being so restrictive in my life, not letting me do anything I want freely. The one topic I rebelled against them was for my gf. I would fight them so much and hurt them so much, but I loved her and our dated culture shouldn't stand in the way. They did accept her after about 4 months, it took so long that she just wasn't as interested or grateful anymore. She knew from day 1 it won't be easy, and even when I was telling them, she told me to fight for her. The second I left to go study overseas, she asked for space, asked for distance, then left me. 
I can blame her for being selfish, for using me when its convenient but throwing me out when it wasn't... But I can't entirely blame her because I am a failure. I can't land a job in my current qualification, I gave up studying medicine because I was driven into severe depression after she broke up with me, and I can't give her what she wanted when she wanted it... Every fucking thing had to be maticulously managed so she isn't hurt and my parents aren't hurt.... Clearly I've done this so poorly to constantly hurt my parents and lose my ex. 
Now that she's gone, I've become so angry, I have the problem she had..... constantly angry at everything. I used to be a calm and collected person, barely ever got angry.... people would ask if I get angry, even she asked. Now I'm just a ticking timebomb waiting to explode. I am constantly annoyed at my parents, especially my dad. I think this comes from the fact that he was the one who did not want to meet her or include her in our family at first. He was the one who didn't let me drop out of engineering and do something else, he didn't let me look for a part-time job when I was in high school, he always pushed me towards medicine, always put down my ideas of professions that interested me. I wouldn't blame him and his very asian way of thinking, mum was a little better, but still similar in cutting down my profession choices. 
See? Even now I've started to blame them. They do the best they can with what they know. I'm so tired of myself right now, I just want to die. Honestly, nothing could be better than dying right now. My parents will have my older sister and younger brother, they are way more successful than me anyway. They are kids to be proud of.... me? I'm a loser, a waste of space really. I've hurt others enough. I just want to be a memory or less. I don't care, I'm not worthy, I have let enough people down. I yearn for the day something kills me, because I am too much of a fucking coward to even do that. I stared the path down a bridge a few weeks ago... the height gave me butterflies. I tied a rope around my neck, but I wasn't high enough and it started to become just uncomfortable to try and bare for longer. I need freedom from my own mind. I beg for something, anything, just end me.",not depression

"annual depression day : Anybody else get triggered by something and think about a certain event when they’re really sad/lonely? For me it’s my birthday, every year for the past 10.
I remember loving my birthdays up to that point. We always had a tradition of singing and cutting the cake during at some point in the night. For my 11th birthday, whatever happened that day, my dad and sister either forgot or didn’t care enough to wish me happy birthday. To add insult to injury, it was just me singing with my mom that night while my dad and sister hung out upstairs with their doors closed. I know this might sound very whiny, and this WAS an isolated incident, but the fact that I can still hear my moms “happy birthday to you” and remember the tears streaming down my face afterwards while I ate my slice in my room just serves as a reminder to how heartbreaking this event(no matter how small or insignificant) was to me. Every year from that point on I’ve cried on every single one of my birthdays. Not just because of this event, but mostly because I’m just always lonely on my birthdays haha.

"Do this when it gets too hard to handle : There's no doubt that when it comes to depression, we sometimes feel like it's too much to handle, we're trying to keep too strong through this that when it becomes too much, we try to end it all because we don't want to stay for the breakdown. Some describe it as being locked up in a dark room with a window to see everyone else be happy, while others say it's like standing between two walls that crush you more and more. So, what do you do when the walls crush you so badly that you feel like you can't breathe, you don't wanna live anymore and death would be more painless than life?
Observe. Be aware. Accept. Let go.
See, if two mental walls pushed you in the middle for a very long time, we would be so annoyed that we'd then try to push them back because so many people tell us to fight our depression; so, we try to fight it, thus end up breaking our metaphorical arms, feeling desperate because we've tried everything, and when you fight too much and try to resist too much, you feel like you've been defeated. I say: **STOP FIGHTING.**
All you have to do is be aware of that feeling that comes and goes. Depression will be there most of the time, but sometimes it's not. We can all agree that depression isn't always equally horrible. Sometimes, it gets annoying, it bothers us and we can't focus on our work, and sometimes it gets unliveable and we try to end it all because it bothers us way too much. You have to be AWARE of those feelings, you have to KNOW when they're happening. You have to understand that when shit gets too tough, it's not you being weak, but it's your depression telling you to stop resisting pain. Accept the pain, let it come and go, but you have to do this while being aware of it happening, you have to notice when it happens so that when you think of ending it all, just remember that it's not you.
Sometimes we get too lost in depression, we think that depression defines our personality and that without depression we would be losers, hence people think that depression is a good thing. This is a wrong mindset. Without depression, you would feel exactly the same - except the negativity. Everything will become manageable, you will be more focused, more energetic, more everything + less negativity. Your ""asshole"" or ""smart depressed guy"" personality will be there as well, but only if you want it to be there.
Depression doesn't last forever, and this is for real. It seems like it's forever, but it's not. You have to be aware when the shit times happen, but you also have to be aware when the good times happen, because even though they don't feel like good times, you have to be aware of them so you could evaluate that they could be worse. Some people struggle too hard to be happy, so when something good happens to them, they feel like they don't deserve it because depression doesn't let happy things make them happy. But they do make you happy to some degree, and be aware of it when it happens, because when you think of ending it all, you have to remember these times when good things happened to you despite the fact that you weren't happy, because you have to realize that there are good things in the world and that depression is like glasses that don't let you see them. These glasses, just like any other glasses, don't last forever, they get blurry, they stop working, so naturally they get off your face.
Moral of the story: Awareness is the key, for both the negative and positive situations. When walls push you and you're stuck and can't move, stop resisting, be aware. Always remember that this doesn't last forever, remember this post in your head whenever you think that you're never gonna get rid of it. Truth is, some people can't get rid of it, but depression will leave by itself. Learn to say no to people, learn to give yourself what you want because it helps you to learn self-love because you're giving your mental health some space and freedom. No matter what people you disappoint or make angry, know that you don't have to care about them at the moment. As long as depression is there, you can't help anyone because what happens when you have a flu and try to cure another person who has a flu? Wouldn't that be extremely difficult? Or when being on an airplane and things go wrong, did you know that the passangers have to put on masks on their faces first before they put on their child's face? This is because you can't help anyone if you're fucked as well, so remember what I've just said and survive through this thing. I don't want you to fight it, I want you to let it come and go until it dies.",not depression

"Emotional Depression vs Chemical Depression &amp; how the mind reacts : Many of you probably know this but just in case...
If you have emotional depression, it's because something bad happened recently.  You lost your job and bills are piling up, your best friend died, you lost a child, whatever.  It's an emotional response to a life event.  Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren't the first person to be in this situation, you won't be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.
If you have chemical depression, it's because your body isn't making the right amount of the right chemical, or it's going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It's not caused by an event, it's not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It's a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it's still a bio-chemical problem.
Talk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.
Now, here's the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.
Another example:  You think you're drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You're psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You're brain is stupid. That's all.
Well, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says ""you are depressed!"" so your brain says, ""Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it's because I don't have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!""
So, when you're feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?
If you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there's no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.  You can't talk therapy your way out of chemical depression.",not depression
"Haven't hung out with anyone in 16 months : As the title says. Last time I hung out with someone was in late September 2018.

"My successes doesn't feel rewarding. : I'm sorry in advance if I sound like a snob or an insensitive person for mentioning achievements and successes considering not everyone fared well in their personal pursuits.
A few years back, I was lucky enough to be accepted by a boarding school where every parent wished their child could study. There, I got all A's in my country's equivalent of SAT exams and got a scholarship as a result. During this scholarship, I did another exam and passed it well enough to be able to extend my scholarship and soon study overseas.
You would think after all of this I would be happy and proud. I thought so too.
After getting the results, I felt empty. I got what everyone my age was aiming for and a life-changing opportunity but why do I feel like I still lost? Where is that gratification and sense of victory that everyone was hyping up about? Why am feeling sad and not happy instead?

"Suicidal Break-Up 101 : Dear all, 
I find myself in a difficult situation and in need of some advice on how to handle it. 
Here are the facts:
- I have been in an emotionally turbulent and extremely codependent relationship for the past two years. It is far from healthy and I no longer wish to continue with it.
- My partner (F21) suffers from depression, trust issues and extreme codependency. She rages, can be verbally and emotionally abusive and although I know much of this is due to her mental state, I can no longer handle it.
- She has been living at my flat for the past few months and it’s only increasing tensions. I am her main source of support and I empathise with the fact that she needs an ‘emotional rock’ but I can no longer be it.
- Last Thursday my parter told me that ‘you (me) make me want to kill myself everyday’ and then swallowed an overdose of pills whilst I was at work. She called to tell me, and I called an ambulance to collect her. We spent two days in hospital and she is now staying with my family as her family lives abroad/are not supportive. 
- I’m scared to break it off and ask her to find somewhere to stay as I’m not sure how she will react and am most worried about her safety. 
I’m at a total loss. I love her but being in this relationship is breaking me apart. I don’t want hurt her and I don’t want her to hurt herself but I can no longer stand it. 
My head is a mess and I need time and space to make sense of things.

"STORM BEFORE THE CALM : I M(20) just have dropped out of my current state college(where I have completed 2 semesters in BSCS) to take admission to a different college. I live in Asia and the college I want to go to doesn't take transfer students. This is the number 1 ranked IT college in my country I applied their last year but couldn't get in due to their entry test. This year I am applying via SAT and I'm like so freaked out, I already have wasted a healthy amount of time and money on the previous college. 
My parents are kind of supportive but they can't afford the 4 years tuition etc. This all is making me so nervous that what if I am not able to get into this college.... One of many perks of this college is that most of the students get jobs while studying(probably the 7th semester). I want good for my future as my parents already provided me top education available yet.  I am so scared that what I will do if anything went wrong.  But deep down I have the feeling once I get in there I have to also manage some expenses with my parents but after all that, I'll be able to land a good job.",not depression

She's happily married, but even still. The point is that there are still people out there that can make me feel this way, like maybe one day I'll find someone and be happy with them. I felt like that was something I wasn't ever going to have again.
Too bad it fucking hurts not being with her.",not depression
"Smart guy with a lot of dumb questions : I've really been struggling to post this, since I've always struggled to show any of my feelings towards everyone I know and even towards myself, but here we finally go.
I'm a 22 year-old medical student from Europe, 3.5 years into the studies, everything going well so far, passing all tests without even attending the lectures and starting to study few weeks prior to the test phase. Aside of that everything else has also always been going well for me, safe neighborhood, caring parents, good sportsman, nice friends.
But now it is that I just seem to have lost interest in everything I once loved over the past year or so. Maybe in life in general, since I don't see any sense in this life anymore. I know many people feel like this, but somehow they seem to find answers that keep them going. To me there is no answer to this question, that makes at least any sense. Some people want to be remembered, some want to achieve something for themselves, some don't want to think about these questions. I want absolutely nothing. Everything that I thought I wanted over the past few years only made me fun for a short time. Even when I have a good time going out with friends or so, that just vanishes, when I start to ask myself these questions and can't find an appropriate answer. 
So the best thing I've found to do since this started, is rapidly increase my weed consumption. I've been smoking for quite a few years, but it's gotten a little excessive the last year. I still mind to get my shit done, so I only start after I've finished what I had to do for the day. Then I roll a few fat ones and just try to make my  brain not think about those questions till I fall asleep. I've already thought about this causing all those problems in the first place, so I stopped smoking for 2.5 months last year and it didn't really affect my situation at all. I started again because I think it's just better to not think, than think of questions you can't find an answer to and that stop you from moving on.
That worked well for quite a time, but lately the quetions just keep getting more and more and I seem to find less and less answers. Why did I choose to study medicin in the first place? How could I think this would be fun for so long, even though it's just smashing facts in your brain, so that you can't possibly remember them?
But what hits me by far the most is this: Who the fuck am I even? I feel like what made me finish school without ever trying to ask these questions, is that my father would always have a talk with me when I got a C or worse. This didn't happen really often, but I remember feeling very bad after that for quite a time. I think that's why I still just keep going without even knowing why, I just couldn't stand disappointing him and my mother. So did I make this decision or was it the way society viewed me and I then thought I had to live up to? How can I go on without knowing this? How do I find the answers?
There's a lot more questions I struggle answering, but I don't wanna write too much, I doubt anyone's gonna make it until here anyway. If you read this and proved me wrong, thank you.",not depression
"Can't cope with my job anymore but I'm not good enough for anything else either. :  I  feel so crap. I have CPTSD. I am 29, and have been a support worker for  adults with learning difficulties for 6 years. Sometimes work is  enjoyable enough, especially if I'm on with good colleagues. But other  times I am so stressed and just feel awful at everything I do. Recently  an inspector came into work and made a comment about how staff were not  interacting with the residents enough. But I was, I was talking to the  residents but many of them are non-verbal. I'm a quiet, anxious freeze  type and I really struggle sometimes to interact with the guys as I'm  incredibly self-conscious if someone is in earshot, I'm worried that my  colleagues will judge me for coming across as unnatural and awkward.
I  keep looking at jobs but I'm not qualified for anything. Looking at  office work seems a waste of time because I'm not experienced with Excel  or anything and I don't know why they'd pick quiet and socially awkward  me over literally anyone else? I don't feel fit enough for any job. I  don't seem to fit in anywhere. I have severe social anxiety. When I stay  round my boyfriend's place I can't go into any shared space in the  house as his Dad is around and I'm scared of his Dad judging me  negatively.

The thing is, while it's a great job a d I'm lucky to have it, it is also pointless,  repetitive meaningless work with no upward mobility, I'm front staff and the one with seniority. Everyday when I leave, I'm no further ahead  life than when I walked in in the morning.. 6 years ago. Sure it helped me get a car, pay me rent, help my family, get my dog,... the hours are long, I'm working most weekends, makes it really hard to socialize.. 
I don't know if it's just the depression talking, or maybe I'll get over it. Maybe it's stupid to quit why would it be any different at another job? It'd also be kind of a dirtbag move, one co-worker is out with Cancer right now. It's been stressful for everyone. Do I have the right to add to that stress? 
I have a pile of stuff to do today, and just keep thinking, even if I get it done instead of putting it off again, what will happen? I'll get in trouble, but that's not enough of a motivator.

Sat down, looked at the problems, and while they were all a lot harder than the problems we had done up to this point I should have been able to do them still.

"Coming to terms with what's ailing me. : First time poster, and honestly, just discovered this subreddit (even though I knew one must have existed out there). 
Over the past month or so, I've come to terms that what I am experiencing is, at the very least, in part due to depression. I have yet to see a therapist (and should begin shopping around, to be honest), and it was easy to put in the back of my mind when coupled with other medical problems I'm trying to sort through (incidentally, if anyone wants to take a stab at my recent post in /r/AskDocs, I certainly wouldn't mind...).
I'm mostly posting because I hate how alone these feelings make me feel.
I apologize, I don't really have planned out what I am going to write, I just *know* that writing something could be helpful.
What I've been feeling the past few months, and honestly what I've probably been feeling for the past 18 months, is an unyielding loneliness. Yes, part of that is because, with my current job, I spend half my time (or more) away from my wife, and see her mostly on weekends. Part of that is because I probably haven't fully come to terms with my Dad's death in 2012. Part of that is because I feel like my life, even at age 31, has no direction.
What really prompted me to start talking about it was the physical manifestations from my depression.  I cried for the first time a week or so ago since 2012, for pretty much no reason. I was sitting on my couch, knew I couldn't just ""be alone"", and called up a friend, and just immediately tears started streaming down my face. We didn't even talk about anything consequential, mostly TV and video games, but it was helpful and eye-opening at the same time.
I know one of the contributors is from my undiagnosed medical condition (see that AskDocs thread), even though it likely is a symptom of anxiety/stress/depression. I just feel fatigued all the time (though, I have been working out and trying to lose weight). I'm just antsy and anxious all the time. There is a deep sadness that I can't seem to overcome, but it doesn't even really ""feel sad"", if that even makes sense?
I try to stay reasonable, and try to remind myself of what I felt like *before* I ever felt this way, and know that this can be temporary. It doesn't always help. I feel just stuck in a rut, a never ending cycle of ups-and-downs with my emotions and no clear path forward.
Being alone for most of the week (due to the job) certainly doesn't help. Its a great job, but it made me move from a wonderful city to a rural environment where the average age has to be in the mid-50s. I don't have any friends down here, just aquaintences and work colleagues and the like. As I've gotten older, a good chunk of my friends have moved away from the city and/or started families, which is truly awesome, but means I see less of them.
I dunno what more I should/can type. I just kind of spitballed a bunch of my thoughts, and its made me feel a tiny bit better. I'm open to advice and suggestions. This is new to me, in the terms of even acknowledging what I'm feeling. Thanks in advance, folks.",not depression

"I don't normally remember my dreams but when I do it gets weird. : So I had this dream about a week ago and I still think it is the oddest I have had to date. I can post other dreams if anyone is interested. Now this dream may need a little explaining though. It was about a family of a dad, a grandma, a daughter and a son. (The daughter was the older of the two.)
So I don't know where it starts but this traveling attraction arrives and it is like a horror attraction but not, I don't remember too much but there was a lot of hype for it.
The family goes to it and the father gets killed by one of the exhibits then becomes apart of the attraction. He then kills the grandma and the son, the daughter escapes and is driven home by her dead father with my brother in the taxi, (only time he was in the dream) the girl says farewell and then realizes she is in an alternate reality where her family is alive still and then as she settles her original father comes back and kills her alternate father while making a really weird noise before he gets killed by like the neighbors I think and that was where I woke up.

As you grow up, all those special milestones and moments that you share with people - turning double digits, sleepovers, christmases, people looking after you when you were sick. 
Eventually you become an adult, and that’s where people really start to stop giving a crap about you. Suddenly you’re expected to contribute to this shitty world, and if you don’t, or you’re ‘different’, you’re nothing.

"My girlfriend (22) is depressed, but she’s taking it out on me (M 25) : My girlfriend of two years seems to always be depressed. I try my best to be there for her but I feel like she gets so overwhelmed by everything that she has no patience with me and takes it out on me. 
At 22 she goes through a lot. She’s currently working on her masters degree, while also having to take care of her nieces and nephews (5 in total) from like 7 am to 6 pm every weekday until their parents come to pick them up and making sure the house is spotless before her parents come or else they yell at her. She’s struggling very hard to make and keep friends. The friends she wants to have (the ones of about 5-6 years) are ghosting her for no reason and want nothing to do with her even though she’s done nothing wrong to them. There are two people she talks to now that she knows from school, but it feels like she doesn’t want to try with them in fear of getting ghosted and pushed away again. 
She feels like everyone is constantly mad at her and it persuades the actions she takes. The other day she felt like her family would be mad at her for buying a hydro flask, even though it was with her money and her sister even found it for her on Facebook Marketplace. 
With this I do feel like her patience is very thin. I do get on her nerves sometimes I will admit, but I personally feel like the way she reacts when I do something so small and unintentional, is too much.
For example, two nights ago I was at her house. She has a Brita water container that I used to fill my bottle with, so as a courtesy I wanted to fill up the container again. She was thankful and helped me hold the container while I put water in it with her retractable water faucet. I filled up the container and took the faucet out, but in the process I accidentally wet her pants a little bit. I thought she would just say something like “You got me wet! Can you hand me a towel?”, but instead I got “What the hell dude?? Why would you wet me like that??” And I told her “I’m sorry, it was an accident, I didn’t mean to”, but she continued being aggressive about it, which got me frustrated because I kept apologizing. I got her a towel and dried her off and said sorry again. I personally don’t think I should have been met with this aggression. This went on for about an hour, with the argument getting worse to the point where I wanted to storm out of her house.
My girlfriend is extremely insecure and I try my hardest to reassure her, but sometimes it’s difficult because she doesn’t believe the things I say. Last night I took her to class, but before that I wanted to do something with her (sexual wise), so I went down on her and kept telling her that she is beautiful (she has newly formed stretch marks and it’s really effecting her). I made sure to let her know that I’m attracted to her, but then later that night she texted me and basically said she doesn’t want to talk to me and how could I do something so horrible. I was really confused. She explained to me that I had liked a picture with a girl showing her “skinny stomach” and she kept saying “go date a skinny girl then”. I was extremely confused because I don’t really like pictures like that, especially knowing my girlfriends insecurity. So I asked her if she could at least tell me what social media it was on so I can check my likes (which I did and found NOTHING). She basically told me “why does it matter, you still did it”. And then she told me goodnight. But me still confused I tried calling her multiple times, with her rejecting the call, and then I texted her saying “well you saw the picture, can you screenshot it to me so I know what you’re talking about?” She finally did after ignoring me, and it was a picture of a youtubers wife posting a picture of her being proud of her body since she had been working out a lot. And I finally understood her. What I don’t understand is that I liked that picture two years ago (July 30th, 2018) when her and I were six months together. How she found that I liked it was super confusing to me. But she basically asked me not to like pictures line that anymore, and I explained to her that I already don’t. Which she got frustrated about because she just wanted me to tell her that. 
I don’t know if it’s something I’m doing? But I personally feel like what I’m doing isn’t that bad to get such an aggressive response from. I admit I get angry and mean, but only if she jumps out of the gate being aggressive. I’ll match her tone and then she’ll get mad at me for having a tone. I explain to her “by you telling me I have a tone is giving me a tone.” because I know when I talk to her I try to talk very calmly.
What the hell can I do. I want to be with her and she’s an amazing person, but once she gets angry she’s mean, aggressive, and will push everyone away (but still expect them to come to her even if she started it)",not depression

"I cleaned my room and that’s a huge accomplishment for me : It may seem silly but I was off work for a month and a half, I took a personal leave of absence. I told myself during my time off, I was going to clean my room. I didn’t. During that time, I pretty much just stayed in my bed and slept all day, as much as I could. It was so hard to get out of bed. I did work out a few times but as soon as I got to the gym I felt too exhausted to really do much. I recently went back to work last week and it was...rough. I only work 3 days a week (12 hr. shifts) but it’s so fucking exhausting socializing with people for that long and having to pretend to be happy and upbeat. Everyone was really nice and happy to see me but I still felt so depressed. I just wanted to leave and be alone. I’m still not at a point where I want to socialize with people outside of work, but I wanted to force myself to do stuff. I told myself yesterday I was going to start the week off right and clean. I didn’t. BUT today, I managed to clean! My room has been a mess for...shit, a long time now. I threw away a bunch of random shit and I feel so much better having this clean space around me rather than a mess. It obviously isn’t going to cure me, but it’s a good feeling.",not depression

We dated each other for about two months and I was the happiest person ever, but then I caught her cheating on me with another dude from my school. Another one month in depressing feelings and suicidal thoughts past. There was a moment (3months) that I don't give a single shit about anything and I was happy, then this girl comes in my life. She is about 500km away from me but we text each other every day. Obviously that's a relationship from distance. At first, I was happy for the first two months, but right now I just want to see her, I want her to be with me, I want her to be in my arms, I want to hug her and kiss her every time I see those green eyes...

Now, every institution is different, perhaps not all schools have these services (that would really suck), and the perks/services you get may depend on you institution, but it's worth finding out.

All my friends betrayed me th girl that i feel in love 2 years ago is now in a relationship with a good friend of mine. 
My bestfriend betrayed me because some false rumors about me literally everybody switched on me because some junkie told shit about me being a snitch and snitching on him and dealing with the guy who ripped him, but i wasn't even there i had nothing to with.
So what happend its that the guy that spread the false rumors got ripped in a deal for pills (alot of pills like 3 thousand ecstasy pills), so that guy reached out to me so i can provide him pills because i was the plug. So i thought you know what if everybody switched on me im gonna switch on them too so i started dealing with this guy and apparently some guy in the group of the client still talks with the guy that spread the rumors and (we were good friends with that guy but he got heavy on drugs doing heroin, meth..) he called like im gonna kill you this and that i didnt got scared but i felt good because he owed me alot of money and i felt like: ""ok now that guy is out from my life"" i felt a relieve but then he started lying to all my friends and they believed him.
Later i came to the city where all my friends were and i asked my best friend to come and smoke a joint with and talk a bit i was gonna tell him the truth and chat with him but was still paranoid. Then i told him to come to this place but i wasnt exacly at that place i was like in the other street watching if he would come alone, i was a bit high and then i thought: ""oh come on he is my best friend he wouldn't betray me""  and i went to the place and waited a couple minutes then i saw him coming with 2 guys more and they didnt look too friendly luckily they didn't see me, i ran i ran so fast and didnt look back they was up to something i remmeber that they had brass knuckles and knifes allways, i can fight im not scared to fight but they probably had knifes and they were three guys. 
I ran then i stoped i smoked a cigarette and felt so bad i didnt cry but that hurted me my best friend betrayed me, he asked me on messenger ""where are you?"" i left it on seen then he blocked me i really felt so bad i had nightmares for weeks about killing my friends, like shooting them or poisioning them.
That was like a month ago, but then i see on facebook that this girl i felt really in love with her i loved her to death i saw her status: ""in relationship with...""  I was like damn fuck me a good friend of mine see was with him when i used to go to party with her and hanging out with her she claimed to be a lesbian and she said thats why i cant be with you she claimed that she got raped and she couldnt be with guys. I cried for her did alot of drugs because of her, when i saw her for the last time she said she didnt have much money i used to deal small amounts of drugs back then i emptied my pocked and showed her my dirty money and offered her money then she said: ""oh you are so childish.."" that broke my heart she was 21 and i was a kid 17 years old i really wanted her i gave up on everybody for her...
I remmember we kissed in her room till 4 am we almost had sex but she said that she was scared so i said sorry and felt sad she said that we could be friends i said i should be going my mom is waiting for me she hugged me and i left in my moped i cried all the way home. Then 2 years later i see this i felt like shit she wants a bigger guy that can protect her and take for her but back i was i kid in her eyes..

"Colorado : I finally visited Colorado to map out the next steps of my life. I’m staying in a dorm with a friend of mine that I’ve known for years via Instagram and finally got to meet her in real life after like six years of video chats and phone calls. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t in love with this girl. I mean she’s everything I expected, and then some. She’s energetic, very smart, beautiful, and we know each other very well. She’s also taken by somebody a lot smarter than me that lives a lot closer to her. I know that if I tried to make a move at this point, it wouldn’t be wise. My spiritual beliefs are what’s keeping me secure. I believe in reincarnation, and therefore if I took her from this guy (or attempted), I’d simply be depriving myself in another life. It’s shitty karma. She’s been letting me sleep in her bed with her (not sexually; we don’t cuddle or make physical contact really of any kind) and honestly it’s enough. This girl makes me want to see the next day, every day. I didn’t actually think I’d ever be able to meet her. It’s almost like Pandora’s box, now. I’ve found something in this life that’s not only worth staying alive for but worth waiting for. She’s told me her and her boyfriend don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things long term. I’m not here to get in the way of her or their relationship. I just want to enjoy this time I have with her because it’s only 11 days until I go back to Alabama. I’m not supposed to see her again until the summer. She wants to come see alabama and visit my home. And then I’m supposed to move up here eventually and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t for this girl. To her knowledge, I’m up here to look at colleges. Maybe this is really cringe but this has been the most bittersweet time I’ve ever had in my life and all I can do is be polite and try to have fun while I deal with all of my own nonsense. It has helped my depression though. It’s given me a little more hope and more will to live. I just hope I don’t fuck up.",not depression

The last “productive” thing I’ve done is go through basic training which is literally the first step in anyone’s military career. I have not become operational, I have not even started class or gone through any additional training. My “job” is to exist and check in at certain times for accountability purposes, I don’t even do anything as basic as janitorial work. I’ve also been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and a couple months back I struggled with substance abuse. I’m in the middle of a desert, too young to drink, in a rundown building that’s illegally overcrowded. Could give more details on all of this if requested, but the point is I’m aware that I’m not doing too hot. That being said, my main focus has been bettering myself and not inflicting my pain on anyone else. Most of my friends have graduated and went on to another base or permanently discharged back home. I struggle with socializing and making new friends so when I make a friend I don’t quite get attached or dependent but I do treat them better and tolerate more than someone with more connections would. This all being said, I’m not doing myself any favors by being passive.
Last night I proceeded to pull the plug and piss all over it with a long term friend from back home. She’s my age and we’ve known eachother since 2nd grade. I’ve done a lot for her over the years, mostly just verbal/emotional support. Like every single day on the bus until we could drive and then some. We stopped talking around that time but reconnected a couple months ago, and gradually I started expressing to her how I’ve always been depressed and suicidal I just keep it to myself but it’s getting worse (esp with not having control over my life). She’s told me it hurts for her to hear that and that she’s always there for me if I needed it. She and her friend invited me over New Years and after expressing how suicidal I was she “comforted me” until I stopped crying and then made up a story of her friend’s sister being in the hospital and that they had to check on her, and I had to go home. I was shitfaced drunk and still shaking from the breakdown I’d just had and she lied to my face and sent me out into the cold to figure shit out. Anyways, I noticed some discrepancies and called her out on it last night. She “apologized” but not really as there were more excuses for her behavior than genuine remorse. This isn’t the first time she’s fucked me over so I wasn’t backing down and then she had her friend from that night start texting me too, which I ignored. She gaslighted me two weeks ago when I was home and she gaslighted me last night.
Before that text last night I hung out with another girl on my base who is currently married. We actually met in a mental health institution and nearly got married but I cut it off. We gave eachother space, she ended up getting married to a different guy over Christmas, and now here we are the best of buds. I’ve felt wronged by her in the past, ex. she only talks to me when she’s really low and needs someone to pull her up, but when I’m low or even neutral just bored and want to hang out she’s always too busy. Generally I have kept it to myself, telling myself I’m just being pessimistic or jealous of her new bf/husband, but it’s been feeling too often to be made up in my head. Last night she was low again so we went out for dinner. Even after eventually admitting to her that I was making plans to end my life just the day before (two days ago now) we mostly talked about her. I didn’t get upset about it though I’m used to it. What did upset me was that she kept trying to get me and my waitress to flirt. She said she was cute and I agreed, I guess that’s all she needed to hear to make awkwardly direct statements to our waitress that me and her were not together, I was single, flag her down randomly just to bring her to the table for me to talk to her, constantly be searching/staring at and talking about her the whole time once she started. I continuously told her to stop, maybe not assertively enough but my facial expressions, tone of voice and mannerisms went from relaxed smiles to tensed up uncomfortable playing with my straw saying I just wanted to go home. She even waived down another waitress to ask if ours was single (she wasn’t, btw) because “I was interested in her”. I didn’t ask for any of this. I didn’t encourage any of this. If I wanted to talk to my waitress I’d talk to my waitress myself. I felt humiliated and emasculating afterwards. I was upset and had nothing to say and she was texting on her phone so we didn’t say anything on the way home. I was generally doing very well yesterday, lots of smiles and no stress. After dinner I was visibly upset with the exception of tears. We got back on base and she said she’d text me last night and I said alright see ya. Not to any surprise she didn’t, but after texting girl#1 my neighbor I texted her too. I expressed that I understood she had good intentions but her actions upset me and that she said she’d text me but didn’t. I said I wasn’t mad upset or disappointed, I’m just sensing in general that I’m putting more energy into our relationship than she is. I apologized if I caused her any more stress while she’s in class and wished her the best of luck. In the morning I got a structured reason 1, 2, 3, 4 reply of how she was innocent and how I’ve made her look bad. I told her that she’s making herself look bad by bringing up my decisions and her reputation in the military when I was discussing our friendship. Then she said that broken people can’t fix broken people, she’d done everything she could for me, and that she can’t force me to “open up and help myself” because she’s better than that. Also I should mention that in the past she’s used my substance abuse against me in arguments.
I’m sorry this is so long. I tried to stay on point and cut out a lot of details for whoever sees this but I seem to have fewer and fewer people to talk to. I’m going to cross post this.
The first girl I wrote about, my neighbor, told me that I wasn’t kind to her and I’m too dramatic to deal with. The second, my friend on base, thinks I’m a lost cause and ungrateful for our friendship. I have screenshots of both conversations.",not depression

"I'm just going to disappoint him : To summarize myself to avoid typing out everything ludicrous detail about my life, I am almost 19, dropped out of highschool, have not enjoyed life for as long as I can remember, and have tried to kill myself once. The only person who has made me feel alive is my stepbrother, who during the time of our parents divorce and immediate remarriage bonded over the misery. I am a year older than him, but due to some rediculous reasons spent the last year studying in Australia (I am American) away from all my family. He is graduating highschool this June. We had made plans to move out together this summer and do our own thing. However, I got stuck in China after visiting my mother due to the coronavirus. It caused me to not return to Australia and I dropped out of my college. That nonsense aside, I told my stepbrother that'd I'd be ready to just move back to the US and start working until he graduated. But being stuck in China has reminded me how miserable I am. I guess surviving on my own for a year distracted me. Now I don't even remember what I'm doing. I've tried to find something I enjoy doing my entire life but I just can't find happiness out of anything. So now I feel stuck. I said I wanted to move out with him and start a new life doing our own thing. But I'm just going to end up disappointing myself. That's just going to make me end up disappointing him too. I'm not a happy person, and I feel like I just drag down the people around me. I've been putting off going back to the US because of this. I'm starting to feel suicidal again. I've gotten uncontrollably angry at myself, moody and I sometimes just cry until I can't feel my emotions anymore. I stay up as long as I can every day so I don't have to put effort into falling asleep. He tries to reach out to me casually but I don't  feel like I can even talk to him. He's such a great person, but I don't think he really understands how I feel. I feel gross thinking about telling him I'm still depressed. I had believed I could bring myself to live if it meant I'd be around him. But I just want to curl up and die. I don't know what I want and everything I try to live for ends up a disappointment. He shouldn't be dragged down by me. I can't stand myself. I made a promise to him and now I can't hold myself to it. I'm fucking disgusting.",not depression

"Celebrating a tiny victory after battling for so long : For about 10 years I couldn't keep my living area clean, I could do a mega clean that would take 2-3 days to finish when people were coming over ( which was maybe 1/2 times a year because I hated people coming over) but after a few days it was back to unclean. Dirty dishes everywhere, clothing everywhere on the floor, food going bad, junk ect ect. I just felt so defeated because I have a tad of ocd/ germaphobia and I knew I'd spent ages cleaning once I started and it would tire me out and give me that dreaded reality check that I was such a disappointment for living in a dirty place.. So i just didn't even try. 
But now.. 
I just hit the 2 month mark where I keep my apartment clean, dishes are done ( I try to do it every day) , washing is done( my basket is empty, holy hell), clean sheets and regular vacuuming (room feels so light). I have no concept of time so I use songs and my coffee maker (lol) to keep track of time and do tidying up during a song of when I'm waiting for my coffee, laundry or food to cook. 
It feels bizarre and at first it felt like a big chore and voices in my head saying I was just faking being a clean person and it's pathetic but now tidying up is slowly becoming a part of me. I'm proud each time I put away things. 
It's weird how much easier it's getting and frankly I feel like I'm dreaming. I am even scared to even share this and be too happy about it.. Because I fear it will all go wrong now I told someone. 
 I'm slowly beating my mental illnesses ass (depression, anxiety, ptsd, borderline) but I still have a long way to go. I still need a job so I can start paying my month's overdue rent and not lose my apartment. But now I feel like I need to protect my little home and not give up.",not depression

I try to stay positive and be happy but it’s just so hard. I feel like no matter what i do nothing is good enough and it’s just wrong. i’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend the father of my child for over 3 years. i know i’m not the only one that feels like i can’t do anything wrong or that i’m just a burden i think everyone feels that way about me. even my boyfriend said if i’m alone i won’t be able to deal with myself. I feel like i walk around with signs on my forehead that say “TREAT ME LIKE SHIT” “BE MEAN TO ME” “BE FAKE” “LIE TO ME” “CHEAT ON ME”. it’s like i attract all the fake people. i just sit at home with my daughter all the time i never go out anymore if i do it’s just to like go out to eat. i kind of miss when i was a freshman in high school and i thought i was the shit. people QUICKLY reminded me that i was not the shit at all and just in fact shit. i’m not sure what to do at this point as i try to feel good about myself but am constantly brought down by my boyfriend and parents. i feel like i’m not able to care about or focus on my own happiness and if i even try to for one second i’m called selfish. i try to make everyone happy and go a long with what they want because if i don’t things are just worse. i have had problems with depression since I was in 7th grade. at first my boyfriend was helping now it seems to just be making it worse. i feel like just a huge burden on society and that i shouldn’t have ever even been born in the first place.,not depression
"Stopped taking care of myself and apartment found an angel to help : So about a year and a half ago I feel into a deep depression. Worse then I ever experienced. I was working 50+ hours a week as a substance abuse counselor and interventionist. I would come home and not be able to do anything. Not only was I not taking care of my apartment but I also stopped taking care of myself. After about 6 months of shame at how out of control my apartment had gotten I went to see a therapist. She did not think I had depression so much as burn out from my job. I saw her weekly and worked on just doing 1 thing each week to take care of myself and my apartment. Then the burn out really caught up to me and effected my job performance. I was let go but given the 300 hours paid leave I accrued and unemployment. I had never been more relieved in my life. I now had a cushion to take time to focus on my health and well being. My primary care doctor changed due to insurance and at my first physical she saw an anomaly in my records.  I had always had weight issues and it had been brushed off as bad diet and exercise by my former doctor and the endocrinologist she referred me to.  The new doctor noticed one thyroid test missing. Thyroid antibody test. After the results came back it showed that my Thyroid Antibodies were 100 times higher than normal. This means I had Hashimoto Thyroiditis. An auto immune disorder where your body attacks your thyroid like it is a virus. Causing lower metabalism(weight issues), sleep issues and chronic fatigue.  This coupled with my burnout is why I became so depressed. I was put on meds to help with weight as that was the only thing that could be treated for now. 
I was able to put a lot of work into my apartment and after 5 months found a new job I love without being overworked.  Now my apartment was a slow going process since I let it get so out of control. I got to a point were I got rid of bags and bags of trash and clutter. Just random things I held onto for no reason. I was cleaning up after myself as I went (washing dishes, taking out trash, sweeping) trying to make sure it didn't get worse. Then a month ago the building got roaches. I signed up with my neighbors for fumigation. The building manager sent me a letter that the exterminator had made horrible accusations about my apartment. That I had cat waste on my floor and I lived like a hoarder. I was angry and devastated. One thing I always did was take care of my cat. So this was just not true. And after getting rid of so much stuff to have this said was devastating.  They said they would come back in a week. I found even more things to get rid of. Clothes, small appliances even one of my tvs. I bought a new litter box and litter tracking mat for my cat. I vacuumed every spec of cat litter. Only to be told no change and we need to discuss next steps. Now I was angry. When I asked what the issue was, stating I did what they asked. I was told clutter isn't the problem your apartment is too dirty. This is a bait switch I feel. But whatever. I made the appointment and was told they would do a new inspection at that time if I wanted. So I looked around and was lucky enough to find a wonderful woman who agreed to deep clean my apartment for only 65$. She is here now and already the difference is huge. The layers of grime of the floor and in my bathroom are gone. I promised myself I will never get to this place again. I acknowledge I let things get out of control but wish my building manager had been more straight forward and clear as to what they took issue with. I will update after my meeting but thanks to this wonderful woman I don't see an issue.",not depression

"I feel coerced, not supported, to not harm myself. : Idk this is just a rant because I don't think I'd ever have the guts to tell this in face to someone especially friends or family but I feel as if I'm not supported by either. Anytime I've ever had the confidence to speak I'll get dogged down by ""you have no reason to feel like that"", or ""your life isn't difficult don't complain"". I've never really been to a therapist or anything like that but I always get thoughts of hurting myself, but I can never bring myself to do it, which is a good thing I guess. But it's not because I feel supported not to, but coerced by how everyone would just perceive it. Idk I'm just glad I have a space to vent whether read or not here it helps.",not depression

"They just keep asking : It feels like everyone just keeps asking if I'm suicidal these days. Most of the people I know are aware that I have been depressed for most of my life, but recently 2 people at my job found out after I had a breakdown in front of them(from switching meds). Well less than a day after that all 140something people I work with knew and thus began the last 7 weeks of added fucking misery to my shitty existence. At least twice a day someone will walk up all slow and fucking dramatic, half the time iv never actually had a proper conversation with them. But the will start a random conversation before dividing straight into the whole why are you depressed are you suicidal why aren't you just happy line of questioning.
So to answer the question once and for all no I am not suicidal, I just spend almost every second of every day wishing that someone great situation would arise where in I die and nobody else is injured and nobody is to blame, it's just me dead with nothing to be said about it.",not depression

"Spouse of a wonderful women struggling with Depression : Hello, I’m coming here to seek advice on how to help my wife with the struggles she faces.
Let me start my saying my wife is amazing, kind, loving and everything I could ever ask for, she is such a wonderful person, it really hurts me to see her hurt.
When we first started dating she was very upfront about the fact that she struggled with depression, so I went in thinking I fully understood... but as the years have went bye I’ve realized I don’t, this however doesn’t change my love for her, if anything it makes me love her more... I often try to help, but it most the time it only seems to make things worse..
Overall I find myself feeling like a failure, wondering if her pain is because of the life i provide, I feel like if I could just do a little more or give a little more she may not feel the way she does... 
I love her to death and I just want to help, is there any advice you may have for me that may he our situation? If I could take her pain I would, but that isn’t any option... what can’t I do
Thank you",not depression
"Just smile : I'm not sure if anyone is going to read this but if you do, I want to tell you about why you should be grateful for what you have, and I'm talking about whatever you have.
I used to be an orphan, my father had a heart attack in 2004 and my mom died from cancer in 2005. I lost both parents by the time I turned 6. This has been the worst experience of my life and one I have accepted I cannot forget but deal with. 
There was very little caring. Every time I tried to replace my family members with the attenders, I failed terribly. Later when I was around 7 years I realized family can never be replaced. 
Becoming an orphan broke me, and shattered everything I believed in. The worst part is that no one around you understands what you go through and feel everyday. After my mom passed in 2005, I returned to boarding school and became a completely different person, without trying. I was alone, and scared. I wept everyday. I lost interest in everything that mattered to me and couldn't keep things together. I became extremely quiet and shut myself out. I started struggling academically, I couldn't study without crying or remembering my parents. I couldn't focus. I was suffering emotionally. I had no one, absolutely no one to talk to. No one in my family ever reached out to me or said ""everything was going to be okay"". I hated visiting day, because parents came over and had fun with their kids and all I wanted was to have at least one parent visit. I somehow still believed they could come back and I prayed to God everyday for hours. I became extremely religious in that time. I felt vulnerable, there was no one to fight for me, no one to love me unconditionally and I was no longer protected. I lost my trust in people and realized how selfish people were.
We always get old and torn stuff to wear and play. No one ever donates fresh clothes or toys to orphaned children. Till 11 years old I have never worn a dress of my size, always oversized, and I used to long for a rich kids birthday celebration so I could get to eat cake lmao
Whenever the attenders look at you, you have to be either studying or praying or else you would get beaten up. I remember being abused physically for being slow in certain things. Wooden spoons to the mouth if you don't finish your food or spill your food, tight slaps across the face, buttock spankings with hangar and others. There was never a day without screaming.
Fast forward to when I'm doing my SPM...I knew that nobody would adobt me at this age, and when I hit 18 I would age out and have to fend on my own. So I did my best for spm, though I didn't score straight A's, my results were decent enough for me to get in sunway.
Fast forward to when I'm 18, aged out. Just like that I'm out...I have to fend for myself. Slept on the streets on the first few days, depressed and homeless. But I didn't give up.
I was lucky enough that my parents left some money and so I used that solely for my education in college and had to figure everything else out. Like clothes, etc. I worked by teaching kids over the holidays to provide some of these cravings.
I became very independent quickly and I had no one telling me what to do. In fact, I wish I had someone who cared enough to tell me what to do. I became very emotional, quick-tempered and defensive. I put up a wall and didn't want to get hurt by anyone or anything, and avoided everything. I couldn't handle my emotions and I attributed every hurtful situation to not having my parents around. I contemplated suicide every day.
Overtime, I have felt insecure, and it's very hard for me to trust, but once I trust someone or something, there's no turning back. I have a very big heart and would do anything to help anyone. My struggles and experiences has enabled me to appreciate everything around me and wish the best for everyone. Before I  became positive, I despised the word, I was angry, and hated everyone who had a parent or was supported through life. I guess I was jealous and didn't understand why life had thrown this at me. I decided during my high school days, to turn everything around and fight for myself and my future. I knew I wouldn't have anyone supporting me, and so I was ready to battle it. I set goals for myself and till today, I take it one step at a time.
Life is still not easy, I'm facing racial discrimination in work place and in class
calling me names like K-word,robber,rapist jokingly under the mask of humour to hurt me
 but I'm not letting that affect me. If you are not my friend, I couldn't give a damn about what you think or say about me.
My experiences has made me tough. I appreciate love, even though it's difficult to love, because I'm afraid of losing them. Being an orphan sucks, it's a tough, depressing, lonely, annoying and despiteful life and takes a lot of courage to make the decision to be a better person.
However, all these experiences toughen will up anyone and there is nothing you cannot overcome because you have seen it all, have a really good heart,  genuinely care about others, and want to make the world a better place.

"Some here have gone through psychiatric internment. Some haven't. If you have any questions, I'm here to answer them. : Hey.
It's very often that I see people here discussing their experience with therapy, psychiatry and mental healthcare. All of these vary according to every person, and in the case of the last aspect, every country. 
I'm a Spanish teenager and was interned after almost committing suicide in February 2019. A year ago now. I was put into a ward meant for adolescents (15-17), specifically. I live in a region with a population of nearly 5.000.000, whose total capacity for at-risk teens is... 5 rooms. Individual ones. Only 5 teens can receive attention. You will hardly ever see someone leave in less than 2 weeks, and you'll almost never see someone spend more than 4. It's just a quick fix. A patch. Momentary safety.
For all you who have gone through internment, what was your experience like?
For those who haven't, feel free to ask here. I would've preferred to know about it before heading right into it. It's useful info.",not depression

"neighbor giving me hard time : So i have conflict with my barbarian neighbor, the story began back to a year and half ago when I told his friend not to park his car in front of my house gate and blocking my car inside. After more than a week, one night he was drunken and seek revenge by asking his friend parked his car at the same spot again after I went out. When I came home and request his friend politely to move his car away he then threaten and provoked me for a fight. I knew he took alcohol because of his asian flush face. I was thinking to call the police at that time but I don't want to create too much attention since my family has slept.
The next morning, I went to his home and requested an explanation and told him I was about to call the police if necessary. Then I found that he was actually having mouth fight with his wife since  yesterday and then I saw 3 of his kids, 3 of them age between 3 to 5. I was sympathy to his kids because I was unsure what will happen to his kids if he got jailed or something so I changed my mind. Her wife was scared and kept apologized to me.
But this guy never give up to provoke and threaten me. All these years, from time to time, When ever he heard my family and I are having dinner and chatting in the kitchen area , he will ask his kids to scream purposely to catch our attention or create deep thump sound with either pushing table to the wall or by his fist whenever he has chance. Many times he did that during midnight after 2 am and causing me to move my bed room to another room.
He only make the deep thump sound once and stop for like an hour more and continue again. I was thinking to confront him about this but thinking that he might said that his foot hit something accidentally.  Sometimes when he has fight with his wife, he also slam the door at the kitchen and the sound freaks my family out because the door was made of metal.
My mum and sis afraid of him because his body size is larger than me, they afraid he might hurt me or something. Both of them ask me to ignore him. But he keeps harassing us and even teach his kids doing the same (hit the wall with something hard).
Whenever i heard his sound and knew he is in his house, my heart will start racing. I am not afraid of him because I know what he's doing is wrong. But my family won't allow me to confront with him. That really make me sick and feel like to move out as soon as I get a new job, but what about my family. They refuse to move because my passed away dad bought the house with my mum. Many memories that my mum do not want to give up. I wish I have money to hire lawyer but i don't have that extra funds. Any suggestion will be appreciated.",not depression

"I don't know what to do : So first of all English isn't my first language . But nontheless i'll try my best.  
I have been finding myself in a situation for the last 3 years . And I am not able to get myself out of it.   
I have a severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I already made clear with myself that i won't commit suicide. I've always been very curious and inquisitive and i don't what to miss anything in the future. That's why I could never do it. BUT that doesn't stops me from thinking about it. I think I know the 2 main reasons for my depression. My family and my social life better to say lack there of. My family actually seems like the nice family from next door. We never had any money problems or anything like that. But on the inside my family is falling apart. My biggest brother confessed last year to my mother that he is depressed and he couldn't go to work that day because he couldn't be sure he wouldn't drive his car in a wall. He went to a op psychiatric clinic. At first it seemed like my mother and him would start to get back together and were starting to build up a strong bond between them. But then it all went south. They only were fighting when she would visit him. It got to that point that my brother broke with my family and as he got out of the clinic he moved out. My mother is a mess since she knew about his depression. I think it's because that she thinks she messed up as a mother. But she doesn't only think that because of my biggest brother my second brother. Is also drifting away from us. He gets aggressiv real fast and is almost never at home. Only to sleep.. Sometimes not even that. My little sister shows signs of a depression too for a while now. She doesn't have any good friends in school and the story of my brother seems to do also a great part on her. No we finally get to me. I also don't have any good friends. There is nobody I could talk to. But first I want to finish the part about my family. I am kind of a geek. So as soon I noticed some weird behavior of my dad. I installed a software on his laptop. 2 Days later I got the result I was waiting for. He used multiple dating sites to flirt with other women I couldn't find out if he already met with someone but I believe that he did. Anyway I got him to stop it. At least he doesn't use sites like these on his laptop anymore. I didn't talk to him. I don't want to say how I did it but I believe it worked. He doesn't know that I know about his secret. But I am still in a dilemma. Do I tell my mom about it and definitely destroy our family and let my sister grow up with divorced parents or do I keep it for myself and I can't look my father in the eyes. I have kept everything secret for 2 years now. But still haven't decided what to do. My current plan is to break with my family in few years. As soon as I am financially stable enough to life on my own. I don't want to risk needing to come back to my family because of financial problems or anything like that. My second problem is my social life. As I already said i have no real friends. That is not really true I do have a friend. My best friend. But we after school he moved to another city. We rarely see each other. And each year it gets less. I can't talk to him about my problems because he got some weight to carry aswell and I don't want him to be concerned about me. I am singel for 3 years now. I only had one girlfriend. And she was abusive towards me. Since that I almost never talked to a girl of my age group outside of work. And I feel that I am drifting closer towards the abyss each day. I wake up go to work get home go into my room and go to sleep. There is rarely something that disturbs that circle. My biggest fear is if I break with my family and move to another city that I won't meet new friends. And in the end I die alone. With no fun in life. I don't know what to do and how to get out of this situation.

"I hate my fucking brain : I discovered this subreddit today, and i have been reading a few posts. And i have readed some that describe situations where depression isn't validated at all, or feel themselves that they don't deserve to feel better, which obviously doesn't help. I feel that way too, but the more fucking disgusting thing is that I already have been a year in home, doing nothing but going to several therapists, and even then, I didn't progress even a bit, because or he/she doesn't ask me to give my opinion or express myself, or he/she doesn't speak a word and i have to progress myself from almost nothing, if you have been to a psychoanalyst you'll know what im talking about.
 And it's already difficult to talk about it, even more when you feel that you are complaining for nothing, and you are afraid to say that you are not following what he/she said you to do at all because it's hard. And that's exactly what encloses you in a loop, thinking you don't deserve to be comprehended, not communicating with your therapist and lying about your progress, not progressing because of that, and feeling more guilty. I don't know if I have expressed myself correctly and can be understood, but that's what i can say at the moment. 
I'm conscient of the depression symptoms, but even so it's a constant fight against your thoughts and the way your reasoning works, and every hour i change between thinking that it's reasonable to feel bad, and feeling guilty for it. I  don't know who's fault is I'm afraid to tell my therapist how I really am, well, actually now I say it, it's probably beacuse the first therapist i've been in my life and I've been again last year is fucking rude, and it's the same my father has been going to untill the beginning of last year... for like 15 years. Not good. So basically i have to try to be honest. So easy. That's all, I wanted to say it somewhere.",not depression

Im not a therapist, but I do want to help her recover no matter what. She has been to a therapist over the years but that didn’t work. The therapists said that she needed to get her life back together, but she just wasn’t able to find to motivation and energy to do it.

"I wish I had someone who actually cared : Why does it feel like I'm always the one giving 100% but never receiving that same effort? No one I know ever asks me how I'm actually doing. The few people I meet online only ever talk about themselves and never seem to reach out to me when I briefly stop asking them the questions. 
Why does it feel like I'm only here to be used before I eventually get ghosted, seemingly thrown away, no matter how much time and energy I give to keep the connection going? I don't understand. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high? Do people just get bored of me once the spotlight shifts, even temporarily, from them? Am I just inherently unlikable?
My heart hurts from this isolation, but I fear reaching out to the few people I have in my life because many of them feel like I've no right to complain just because my life looks less burdensome on the surface.
I've built a shell around myself that exhibits independence and self-sufficiency, not because I fear letting people in, but because I despise feeling disappointment time and time again from people who I assumed cared. I want to feel vulnerable and thought about for once. I hate always being there for others, but forced to face my demons alone. I hate it, I hate, *I hate it.*
I'm just tired at this point. Is life gonna be like this forever? It doesn't help that there are so many others like me, but I feel helpless because I just feel burnt out caring about others without reciprocation too many times. I'm sorry...

"School Is Overwhelming : I'm in my junior year of high school and I have struggled a lot with school.
My grades have dropped, although, to anyone else it's not that bad. I got my first C ever last quarter but the rest have been A's and B's. But I feel like such a failure because of it. Everyone around me that I've grown up with has instilled to me that I have to great things and be the best and go to college and make lots of money and be smart... but recently I felt so burnt out. I'm in clubs, and extra-curricular, and sports, and most of the week I'm staying 2-3 hours after school for them on top of extra help with classes. I just feel like I can't do it anymore but it's too late to change anything or look for alternatives to normal high school. Recently, I was invited to the National Honors Society, but I'm afraid I'm not going to get in because my grades have been dropping. My parents say that it'll be fine if I don't get in, but they're constantly comparing me to my sister, and I know they'll be disappointed. And I know deep down that I have it better than most. That I shouldn't be complaining because although my parents will be disappointed they only want the best for me. But I feel like I have to keep up their high expectation of me at the risk of making them worry or creating more work for myself. 
College has also been a large discussion with my family. Honestly, I don't want to go to college anytime soon. I think the only motivation I have for going to college is that it's a chance of getting away from my family for a bit and being able to finally be myself. But I have no plans for my future. Everything else in my life has been planned for me or done by my sister that I have never had to think about my future or what I want. In all honesty, I never thought I would be alive long enough to make it to college that I haven't even fathomed the idea of me even going. But now I have to decide what kind of school I want, where I want to be, what should I major in? And I have no answers to any of those questions, and college seems to be everywhere. It seems that wherever I go or whoever I talk to, college always seems to be brought up and I can't escape it. I brought up the idea of a gap year, or maybe going to a community college to get my gen eds out of the way while I figure things out but my parents have completely shut down the idea. 
Friends have also made school hard in general. I used to not really have any friends, just people I went to school with and would talk to because I saw them 7 hours a day. Recently a couple of my friends just don't seem to care about me. They don't care about my struggles because, to them, my life is good and I shouldn't be complaining about these types of things. Which I guess is true, I have two parents who love each other and have stable jobs, but it doesn't make my struggles any less real. They expect me to not have any problems, but it seems they only come to me because of theirs. It makes me not want to talk to them which sucks because I don't want to leave them in the dust even after everything. However, recently I have formed a new friend group, and it's very good and everyone cares about each other. But my anxieties have gotten in the way because I've never known what it's like to have friends that honestly care about you, that have similar interests, and I can be fully myself around. I don't know how to act with them, and I feel myself pulling away because I don't want things to get complicated when I open up to them one day. But they're one of the few good things in my life right now, and they're honestly the only reason why I'm still trying right now.

"The Elephant of Ego and The Black Dog of Depression - Knowing other people have depression doesn't always help a depressed person. : https://medium.com/@breyon.gibbs/the-elephant-of-ego-and-the-black-dog-of-depression-4debe598cdf8
""But I think — in the long run — it helped. In the space of a few seconds, just one sentence, depression became less a complex beast of gargantuan proportions and mammoth intellect to mirror my own, and became more like the reality that depression is an everyday occurrence for millions of people. No different to hay fever. And when I get hay fever, I go to a doctor and take the medicine they give me. I avoid pollen. I look after myself so I can live comfortably.""",not depression
"Crying to the point of wanting to claw my face off : Just as the title says, my chest is hurting too much and I have so much weight on my heart. My husband doesn't seem to appreciate what i do. He works during the week while I take care of our baby, and he says to me he'd rather stay home watching baby than go to work. Now to me, that seems to imply that caring for a baby is easier than his job. Well it's not, and it's pretty much driving me into the deep end and I want to hurt myself. I've cried with such anger that I dug my fingernails into my flesh causing pain and at the same time relief that I could feel it.
And I know you're probably gonna say "" oh that's PPD doctors can give you meds/go see a therapist"" yadda yadda.. I'm tired of hearing it. I'm only writing this because I have no where else to vent and get off my chest. I'm beginning to wonder if the ones who experience depression are meant to so they would eventually take their lives to trim the human population since we really don't have a natural predator to maintain population.. but then again, we are our own predator since we kill off each other through wars, difference of opinion, and just plain stupidity.
That's another thing that upsets me. There are way too many people inventing shit that they feel is justified and then push it on others when they don't agree. We don't even abide the laws of nature, instead we corrupt it and even laugh at it. When I was younger, everything was awesome and never had to deal with the social problems that are going on now. I mean, where the fuck did that even come from!? It makes me sick and hate living surrounded by that shit, I don't even watch TV because it disgusts me too much. I don't want to live any longer having to deal with it .. it's too much wasted energy.

"Yes, I’m Clingy. And I’m Sorry. : I’ve always been the clingy type. And I’ve always been criticized for it. Main reason I am such is because I wasn’t shown hardly any physically affection when I was young. I can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child. And even when they did it was usually awkward. And knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine. 
Either way, being “clingy” is not something society is fond of. It’s regarded as annoying, stupid, childish, unnecessary, etc. And I’ve had people say it to me. Like my dad saying, “You shouldn’t cling to your sister in law like that. It gets on her nerves.” And she is the type to literally shake my hand off if I try to hold her hand, so I eventually stopped trying. A couple friends of mine don’t like physically contact much, so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them. Like my one friend literally shouted “Nope!” and snatched her hand away when I tried once. And the other friend had to give me a sincere talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter. 
I get it, not everyone likes that. And I respect the people who don’t, even when they express it in a rude or unkind manner. But boy does it really add to my self hate. 
Even my one friend who doesn’t mind it will jokingly say things like, “I know, you’re clingy.” And she’s right I am. She may mean no harm by saying it, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t do harm regardless. 
And now people aren’t allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around. But at this point, who cares? I never got physical affection before anyway? Why would I worry about it now? At least, that’s what I tell myself. And others.
I laugh it off. I respect others wishes and space. I brush it off and pretend like it doesn’t hurt. 
But it really, really, really, does. 
Especially when I haven’t been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most. I remember reading an article on a mans life story. He had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him. He mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib, and he’d bawl his eyes out when visitors came by. Just because he wanted to be held. But everyone ignored him. I’d never cried after reading something like that before, but I did. I’m crying just writing about it now. And I did because it struck a cord with me. I can’t remember anything really specific but I do know there were times all I wanted was to be held/reassured by my parents, like any child should be, but I wasn’t. I was pushed away, yelled at, mocked, and called “clingy.”
And they were right. I was. I am. And I’m sorry. I’m really truly sorry. I’m sorry wasn’t shown enough love as child. I’m sorry I don’t have many real friends who understand my feelings. I’m sorry I was wasn’t even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them. I’m sorry I ended up adopted by a family who didn’t really care. And I’m sorry all those things made me who I am. 
I don’t WANT to be clingy. I never wanted to be. I’m sorry I am. I wish I wasn’t. I wish I wasn’t me. I wish I was dead, and then I wouldn’t have be this thing that people despise. 
Again, sorry to all the people that have labeled me as “clingy.” I assure you, when I die, I won’t be. Ever again.",not depression

"I feel my boyfriend drifting but I don't know how to help : Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on this website, but I'm really just looking for advice. 
My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 5 months, the first two months or so were awesome, we were always together or texting or sending each other memes, then most this stopped happening. I figured he might've been going through something and he just needed his space. We're both introverts so I've been there, I also need space from people so I've been giving him his space for a couple months. Today, I went and visited him while he was working (we work together and I had the day off but I occasionally visit him while he's working) and I could tell he looked super tired, and not just from lack of sleep. I could sense that he was down more than I'd ever seen him before, and a lot of the things that I had seen in him I'd also seen in me previously. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago and I've learned to manage it, but a lot of what I was seeing and what he was explaining to me that he was feeling was very similar to how I use to feel before I was diagnosed and I had no idea what was going on. Later that day, I wrote down everything that has helped me, hoping that he might connect with something I had also experienced. He took it pretty well, said thank you, but since then I've noticed small things that kind of scare me. Like he jokes about wanting to die or he want's life to end, but he points out that he would never actually kill himself and that he promises that he's just joking. I'm just worried and I'm not sure what I can do about it, if I can do anything, like suggesting he see a professional? Has anyone else been in this situation before, what have you done if you have been? Thank you in advance :) I really appreciate anyone that's taken the time to read this.",not depression

"One sided friendships? : Do you guys ever feel like your friendships are so one sided? 
It just makes me feel like I’m a shitty person or something. I plan surprises for my friends. For example, a couple years ago my friend was off to college so I got everyone to make her a scrapbook of all our memories so she’d have a piece of home with her. I surprised my boyfriend with a trip to Boston to see his favorite band. I plan birthday dinners. I put in so much effort and time into friendships. I take everything into consideration, the things they like, the things they don’t like, things they’ve always wanted. I never ask for much but for them to pick up the phone once a month if I call them during a mental breakdown, and that’s if I even decide to reach out for help. 
I just wonder if these people that I care a lot about would ever do the same for me. For once I would just like to be shown some sort of appreciation. Not just the words “I’m grateful for you” or “I appreciate you”. See, now I’m expecting things and I’m extremely disappointed. My birthday comes around and it’s crickets. Am I asking for too much?

"Stress and feeling like a failure. : Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to keep it as brief as possible
I'm a 22 (almost 23) year old trans women engaged with my girlfriend of three years, and together we have a one year old son. I love them both more than anything. 
However with an active life of work, fiance, and taking care of a child, I feel incredible amounts of stress. It always seems like on my days off there's just one more thing to take care of, or an errand that requires my time. I usually don't have that much free time as I'm constantly busy with keeping my family afloat. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, they mean the world to me, but holding it all together is taking its toll on me. 
On top of that I have depressive and gender dysphoric episodes. I feel that my depression stems from ""not being good at anything."" I want to be good at... something. At this point, I'll take anything. My two major hobbies are competitive Super Smash Bros Melee, and I get sad about constantly losing, but I also don't internalize that sadness as much because I don't take it super seriously and its more for fun than anything (though watching your rank on the constant decline on the community leader board can really be a bummer at times). My other major Hobby that I am more concerned about is drawing. I've been taking art classes since I was in 7th grade and I was even in AP art. I constantly have a feeling that I'm never improving. 2010-2015 I used to draw for school, and some for fun fan art stuff on the side when I was a nerdy teenager, but 2015 through now, I've hardly done anything. I've made maybe like 3 or 4 completed pieces of digital art and even then I'm not that confident about them. When ever I try to draw today, I just get like, almost physically I'll. I feel like my stomach drops and my heart rate goes up. At work, I have a lot of free time and I try to practice on yellow stickie notes at work but most of the time I usually crumple them up and toss them because I end up not being satisfied. I know that's kinda considered a no no in the art community, but I've been doing this ever since I got a three out of five on my final AP Art portfolio. I tore up a myriad of my AP art portfolio because a lot of it involved self portrait and those drawings of myself were before I even transitioned to female. I want so bad to find time to practice my art, but not even that, just being able to know and internalize that it doesn't have to be perfect, and mistakes are part of learning. But everytime I get to work I just get really really fucking sad and I feel like I'm not ever going to improve because I've been at this for 10 years now. What's particularly upsetting to me is that I have ADHD, so focus is already a big issue. I want to hone in my attention on my art, but get so discouraged when I see people have actually completed a number of sketchbooks, meanwhile I struggle to even get one started and even when I do get started on one, I fill in like two or three pages and then don't pick one up again for months. Digital art is also a big frustration as the number of tutorials, art styles, tricks, etc. are just endless on the internet and with someone like me, it's hard to sit down and actually learn. I can't make it through 5 minutes through an art tutorial of any sort because I just..
 I dunno... get antsy and go watch a Melee clip or a video essay. I don't know how I can easily sit through an hour long video essay about Marxism or whatever, but the moment it comes to the things I really care about, I just can't force myself to pay attention and absorb the learning material. 
I have a long shot dream of making a Sci-Fi cartoon one day. I don't know how to even come close to it considering I can't pay for college, let alone negotiate (argue) medical Bill's with my insurance company in relation to my transition, being barely able to afford the means to keep my family stable, not having enough time to practice, and even if I find time to practice, I just don't out of anxiety or contempt of self. 
It depresses me that I can rationally argue that my dream won't come true and that I'm just going to work a bullshit job for the rest of my life because I just can't get it together. I have days of crying spells where I sit in the shower and have crying fits over gender Dysphoria, depression, and just feeling like a massive failure. 
TL;DR: I suffer from ADHD, Gender Dysphoria, and a busy schedule. I feel those things are getting in the way of me improving at hobbies I want to otherwise improve at, and I feel like a failure for not being able to meet goals",not depression
"I have a lot to say : I am not a person who wants to kill themselves nor do I have too many depressive thoughts. Im just not ok.

One more thing that bothers me is that i think alot of people around me are idiots but of course i cannot say thats true. Its not that they are not book smart, its that they dont think of the questions that really matter like what any of this was supposed to mean and what it means to exist. I would say that I dont think im smarter but i really do feel that way and i think its hurting the way i think about people and my life.

"How a past love is affecting my relationship with my sister. : Ever since high school I've always felt like the guy who has to start plans or conversations to feel involved. It started this persistent feeling of loneliness and sorrow that I feel like is persistent most of the time now. I had a girl I was very much in love with, we talked all day everyday for almost 2-2 1/2 years,  one day she just stopped talking to me and I had to find out through a mutual friend that she felt that I was creepy and overbearing. Now almost 3 years later it still bothers me, and I don't feel like I'm worth love and kindness anymore.
Leading to the more relevant problem, I'm living with my sister and their girlfriend. Most days are ok, but I have this nagging feeling that I'm not wanted, I dont get told good morning or good night, i dont get included in plans, i very rarely get opportunities to talk to or do something with my sister alone. I've tried voicing my concerns before, and I get reassurance that I'm very loved, but then nothing changes, I might as well not exist again.
I dont know if im just emotional and hyper aware of things now that my therapist is having me dredge up thoughts and feelings about my old relationships, but I'm very scared that things that have ruined my relationships before are happening again, and it would destroy me if I had to face a day when my sister doesn't want a relationship with me.",not depression
How does antidepressants help with depression??? : [removed],not depression
"Why I feel like I'm not good enough : Deep down, my darkest desire is simply to feel loved and wanted.  And so I say things like ""I wish I had a girlfriend,"" but that probably gives the impression that I'm desperate and just trying to fit in. But that's not what I really mean. 
Yes, I'm at this age where most of my friends are in relationships. People might describe me as being in the ""prime of my youth"", but if this is the best it's going to be I'm afraid for what comes next. And then there's me. I've never been in a relationship, in fact I've never really had intimate connections with another person before. Honestly, I don't know how to. 
I go through each day as if nothing's wrong, but deep inside I'm  lonely.  And I truly wish that I could have someone who really understands me and will love and accept me for who I am. My friends tell me it's better to be single because being in a relationship comes with a host of its own problems. Others tell me that I just need to be patient, because things will work out eventually. That there are plenty of fish in the sea, that it's just not my time yet, that it's not something I should worry about. You name it, I've heard it. And I agree with them, because for all I know they could be right. But in light of all this, I still don't feel happy.  When most people that I know are in relationships now, and I find it difficult to even connect with people, I can't help but feel like I'm not good enough. Like I'm not worthy. Like there's something wrong with me. Because if there isn't, why is my life like this? 
So yes, I say things like ""I wish I had a girlfriend."" Because I don't want to feel like shit any longer. I don't want to feel like there's something horribly wrong with me. It's not because I want to be like everyone else, it's because I want to feel like I'm worth something.",not depression

But the thing is I hate what I’m doing, even more accurate I hate what I’m not doing to help me and be better. I have lots of goals and objectives, but I keep procrastinating and not doing a thing. The routine also doesn’t helps, I feel like I’m becoming another dot in this world. 
But when I’m singing in the mirror, I feel like I’m the only person and that feels good.",not depression
"Why Am I Upset? : Why am I upset? Fucked if I know.
Because someone special to me has passed and we celebrated her life yesterday? 
Because I had to talk to Mom's headstone instead of her?
Because it was so nice out today but SO doesn't want the windows open? 
Because I hurt all over because genetics? 
Because I'm embarrassed that the bad grip in my hand made me drop a bunch of trays at work? 
Because I'm tired of the chaos at the Sunday job? 
Because I couldn't connect with friends today? 
Fucked if I know.  I do know that I'm upset tonight.  I am tired of my joint problems, especially knowing they run in the family and weight loss won't hurt but neither will it help.  And talking to Mom would be great but I can't.  So I don't know.  Maybe some sleep will help.",not depression

"help me : these are just some thoughts i’m having right now:
I don’t feel anything right now. i’m sad but numb, and honestly, if something were to happen to me, it would probably be for the best. i’m not a good person to be around. the real me is toxic, clingy, emotional, and mentally hurt all at the same time. I feel as if no one is there for my actual feelings, but just for my presence. 
my mom helps, but she doesn’t know everything that’s going on. i’m too scared to tell her. I don’t want her worried about me. 
but no one else, and I mean no one, really cares that much. they’re so used to the girl that is always happy, smiling, laughing, that they don’t understand how a person like me could go through something like this. 
I get called dramatic, looking for attention, selfish, trying to make others feel bad, but i’m really just trying to figure out how to cope. 
right now, i’m laying in bed crying my eyes out, debating on if it’s all worth it. I try removing myself from bad situations, but it never works. 
i’m scared to lose the one I love because of this. he’s been through this, but in a different way. he’s not like me, he can hide it better than I can. when i’m with him it’s hard to hide it, he can see right through it. but I feel like he thinks i’m only putting on a show. so i’m scared to tell him everything that goes through my mind. only he has seen the true me, and to be honest I don’t think he likes it very much. if I had shown him sooner, he probably wouldn’t be with me right now. 
I miss how I used to be. I wasn’t like this. I was happy, excited for life, dreaming of what I would become. I never dreamt of this.

"Grades came in : My grades for this quarter came in. It’s currently 12:49PM CST as I’m writing this. I haven’t been able to sleep as of late due to a variety of things, mostly school though. It’s been rough in school.
My freshman year, I was a straight A student. Finished off the year with a 4.0 GPA. Not too shabby. This year though has been absolutely horrible. The year started off with me trying a new medicine for my anxiety. That kept me from being able to focus on anything. Then my uncle passed away from a heart attack. Only a few weeks later a good friend of mine passed from Leukemia. My depression has been getting worse and worse, as well as my anxiety. This years GPA is a 1.75. I’m entire semesters behind everyone else and I’m crying trying to figure out how to get back up. Nobody will help me when I ask. It’s always the same “you should’ve paid attention” replies. The only teacher that has taken any interest is a teacher that never knew me until this year, and, funny enough, teaches the only class I’m not failing. She came up to me after class one day and sat me down, asking if I was okay, asking if I needed help. I said no, and that I’m fine, just “tired,” but I nearly broke down crying in front of her. 
I don’t know why I’m typing this all up. Maybe I want acceptance, maybe I want advice. All I know is if I fail, I’ll probably just drop out. Maybe worse. I honestly don’t know.",not depression
"I have no privacy, I have no outlet. : Just two minutes ago I was silently sitting on my bed, writhing around, tears streaming down my face, and feeling like I wanted to peel myself out of my body. My emotions feel so bottled up inside me that I’m scared I’ll shatter in public. It’s happened at home before. I screamed, I slammed my head into walls, I bit myself and I would have done worse if I hadn’t been grabbed. I’ve almost knocked myself out slamming my head into a wall once. I collapsed and my vision went dark. But my room doesn’t have a door, because it’s an attic, and I can’t cry. I can’t wail. Someone will hear, or see me. I need to let it all out but I can’t. My seasonal affective disorder is so bad right now. I think I’ve developed dysmorphia? All my features are fine, and everyone tells me that I’m “oh so pretty” but my face looks hideous when I look in the mirror. I need to go out to maintain my mental health but I don’t want anyone seeing my face. I can’t separate myself from the idea that I HAVE to be pretty to be loved my anyone. I can’t do anything. I want to chew threw my wrists and rip out my viens. That sounds so fucking edgy but it’s genuinely how I feel. I want to tear out chunks of my hair. I want to stab a pencil into my thigh. I want to suffer because I feel like I deserve too. I don’t deserve to be happy. Everyone tells me that I’m being dumb. Do you think I don’t know that? Do you think I’m not aware that I’m a huge fucking idiot? I just need someone to tell me what to do. I can’t make myself do what I need to do to make myself better. I need someone to tell me step by step what to do. Because right now I feel like I deserve to die. I have no one.",not depression

"I am angry all the time : Hi,
As a long time lurking of this reddit sub I have finally gotten the balls to try to put in words my experience.
I dont have the typically down problems associated with depression, but more and more I'm realizing that I am furiously angry all the time.
I get so mad at some of the smallest things and perceived injustices and it's hard sometimes to not break my possessions or drive my car off a bridge.
I recently received a horrible grade for a paper in university that I thought was well written and concise. I feel like the teacher has it in for me because I hate her teaching style. It might just be me overreacting, but I am so overwhelmed I just want to drink.

"Will I ever be ""good enough""? : My husband was recently diagnosed with throat cancer. For the last several weeks I've been taking care of him and driving him back and forth to the hospital for his chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Last night he asked me if I would have married him again knowing he'd end up getting cancer. ""Of course,"" I told him, ""I love you and I can't imagine my life without you."" I didn't even have to think about it because the answer seemed obvious to me.
I asked him if he would have married me again knowing how debilitating my depression can be. He was silent for a long time. Then he said, ""I think so."" That was not the answer I was expecting and it absolutely devastated me. I knew it was an honest answer, too, because my husband never lies to me. 
It hurt to hear the person who loves me and knows me the best admit that being married to me might not be worth the effort. He unknowingly confirmed one of my greatest fears: that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be ""good enough"" to be in a relationship.
I've done everything I can to cope with my depression. I've spoken to numerous therapists and tried at least half a dozen different antidepressants and antipsychotics. I force myself to venture out into the world and socialize with others even when I don't feel like it. I eat healthy meals and exercise on a regular basis. Still, my life is riddled with unbearable sadness and frequent thoughts of suicide. I try to conceal my depression from my loved ones as much as possible, so that I'm not a burden to them (and so they won't leave me), but some days the emotional pain is so overwhelming that it seems to burst out of me. Today is one of those days.  
Being married to someone with cancer puts me in a tough position. Everyone expects me to be ""strong"" for my husband, which essentially translates to me ignoring my own needs so I can be there for him 24/7. I'm dealing with a lot right now, but complaining about my own problems would seem selfish and trivial in comparison to what my husband is going through. 
Caretaking is a thankless job. I have to suffer silently while my husband's loved ones cheer him on and praise him for being such a strong fighter. They don't know what happens behind closed doors. They don't see me deflecting my husband's hurtful insults when the steroids make him irritable. They don't see me cooking his meals, washing his clothes, or scrubbing his shit off the bathroom floors and walls when the chemotherapy makes him lose control of his bowels. It's not easy, but I'm willing to do all of these things because I genuinely love my husband. That's why it hurt me so much when he insinuated that I might not be worth marrying again. 
I'm in a lot of pain right now and I need to talk to someone about it. Unfortunately my therapist doesn't have an opening available for the next two weeks. My husband would be the next obvious choice, but I don't want to tell him how I'm feeling because he already has enough to deal with. I can't talk to our friends about it either because they would think I was being selfish.

"How do I make sense of what happened : I am 22F now, but when I was in highschool I was in a 2 year relationship with a girl who emotionally abused me and gaslighted me to the point of myself attempting suicide multiple times. Im not one to get triggered but hearing her name in passing sends me into a spiral. The topic recently came up with my longtime boyfriend as I had been pushing it away for years avoiding the topic. I don’t know how to explain the situation without sounding crazy, because it does sound crazy, why would I date someone I actively hated for 2 years? Why wouldn’t I just leave when I realized I was being abused? I DONT KNOW. Its because I was being manipulated and threatened that if I left I would be responsible for her suicide. Its because I was tricked into alienating all my friends so if left I would have nobody left. Its because when I was still in the hospital after overdosing she continued to tell me how I was selfish I was being. Its how she told everyone I attempted and then blamed my best friend for the reason the whole student body knew I was gone. My closest friend who witnessed it all real time is the only one in the world that truly understands as well as I do what happened and I know she knows why this happened but I don’t know how to express the pain to anyone else without sounding like an idiot.

"Harrassment on Twitter : I am an environmental engineer who studies air pollution. I have a friend who is a war correspondent in Syria. He posted before and after satellite images of Syria at night before the war and at the present day to show how many people have left the country and how much of the electricity grid has been disabled. 
He wrote a column a while back about the environmental consequences of the Syrians war.  Given my research focus, I was intrigued. I commented on these satellite photos, in reference to his article, that a silverlining of ISIS has been a reduction in air pollution in Syria.  However, the human cost has been tremendous.  Yet, I remember you also wrote that artillery, bombs, and munitions are causing forest and brush fires, so I may be wrong.
I checked my twitter and had tons of hate messages claiming I was an ecofascist, a war criminal, and I was saying the Syrian Civil War was a good thing. The ring leader was a guy who like me works in sustainability. He paraphrased my comment and claimed that the Syrian War was good because it killed people, and dead people dont create pollution. He then retweeted this and got his followers to dogpile me, telling me to fuck off and saying I am a genocidal maniac.
I apologized. I acknowledged that my comment was callous, and I deleted it. Many of the people who initially went me hate mail apologized to me. My friend, the war correspondent stuck his neck out and told me and his followers that I wasn't a monster. 
However, the initial guy that misquoted me as saying war is good because it kills people and reduces emissions refuses to acknowledge or admit his mistake. I reached out. I apologized. I deleted the comment that triggered him. But he continues bashing me on his twitter. He makes me so mad because he and I work in the same field sustainability. 
As a liberal, I get hate from the alt-right  all the time calling me a reactionary SJW for bringing up climate change or air pollution. They will claim I have misquoted them even when I link to their articles.  Yet, this guy who is attacking me on Twitter, who works in my field and with whom I share political beliefs is fulfilling this SJW STEREOTYPE.
I get so angry when liberals eat their young. I am a died in the wool liberal, but I can understand why someone younger than me who sticks their neck out to ask a question and then gets dogpiled by people calling them a fascist could easily say screw it and become a member of the alt-right.",not depression
"My girlfriend has been treating me really bad the past few weeks : Around October I tried to kill myself but after that experience I’ve gotten a lot of help. My family is there for me now, I see a therapist, and I take antidepressants. Recently my life has been going pretty good so I decided I’ll start dating someone from my class. Recently out of nowhere she started treating me really bad. She would just completely ignore me. When I ask her a question she usually pretends she doesn’t hear me or responds with a faint answer and moves on; never continuing the conversation. She also won’t even sit next to me anymore and even when I stand next to her she moves away completely ignoring my existence. She talked to everyone else in the class more than she does to me. Even once she wanted a hug from someone and everyone was like ‘hug your boyfriend’ and she gave me a one second one handed hug while looking away from me and everyone was like wtf. Everyone in my class doesn’t know what’s up with her. Even my teacher noticed what’s going on. I don’t want to sound egotistical and ignorant but I did nothing wrong. This behavior just came out of nowhere. Even all my friends and my teacher don’t know what’s going on with her. I’ve been trying my best to be a really good boyfriend to her. I’ve never tried to go against her, I’ve never put her down or even gotten in an argument with her. Even every time I look at her I smile. Over the past week she has only actually talked to me once where we actually had a back and forth conversation that she started. This whole thing has not been helping my mental state. Every time I think about her I get depressed because I see her smiling and actually talking to other people and I just wish she was doing that to me.

* A major tornado hit less than a mile from our home.  (We were fine, no damage or casualties to friends or family)
* I didn't get to vote.  Local polling station was out of power.  Traffic was too screwed up to get anywhere and I wasn't up for the challenge of getting to an alternate location.
* I'm extremely burnt out with my work (2 jobs, planned to quit one but situations have changed)   I seriously can't will myself to get up in the morning and I can't will myself to sit down and focus on the side-hustle anymore.  Been this way for several months.
* My young child is acting like a total jerk.  We're walking on eggshells rn.
* My wife's feeling overwhelmed and exhausted with everything in general.
* An old friend of my wife died.
* Coronavirus is in my state now.  I have no willpower and I'm anxious about going out and stocking up on some supplies in case of a quarantine.
* Our house is a total fucking mess.  None of us have the willpower to get it clean, yet we're anxious and miserable because of it.
* My vehicle is pissing fluid everywhere under the hood from an unknown source.  I have no care to fix it right now.
* I have a got damn fucking toothache from hell.  Probably about to blow all my savings on getting that fixed.
* I should maybe call my therapist, but I feel it's a lost cause.  I'll go in yet again, spend gobs of money, and get nowhere.  At least I have 3 refills left on my meds.
* I can't stop eating crap food no matter how I try.  The bathroom scale won't even tell me my weight anymore.  Just ""H"". I assume that means heavy.

"My 11yo sister told me she wanted to die : I recently opened up about my depression and how I’ve had it for years to her but never about me being suicidal. She told me that she wants to die this year because of how bad 2020 is going for her. I think it’s all because of one friend that keeps framing her for things she didn’t do such as vaping, stealing, and punching her which she didn’t do. All the teachers know that girl is a liar and bad student though and know that my sister would never do those things. I’m worried for my sister and I know how much depression and thoughts of wanting to die everyday sucks. I don’t want her to experience what I’m growing through. Maybe I’ll surprise her with hot chocolate and food she likes tomorrow. Should I tell my therapist that my sister is having those thoughts? Maybe she could get some help and feel better but I’m also scared that she’ll feel worse because of it. What should I do??  I’d appreciate some advice on what I can do to make her feel better.",not depression
"i have been absent from school the majority of the semester : I feel like I'm letting everyone in my life and myself down because I can't make myself go to school. I have it relatively easy in school and have no issues getting good grades when I'm there, but this semester has been shit. I can't physically get myself out of bed some days and I've been home for two weeks. It feels like the work load just gets bigger and bigger and no matter how much I do there's still more.

"Lately I feel like I’m getting worse : I’ve been really lonely for most of my life and no matter how hard I try I can never seem to get better.

And every time I talk to someone they eventually just leave or I end up pushing them away because I think they’re going to leave anyway. I’ve gone to therapy for about 5 years for my social anxiety but I feel like my depression is getting worse. I guess I’ve just accepted the fact that I’ll never have friends and will never be able to talk like a normal person. I don’t even have people to talk to anymore. I usually end up talking to myself, as strange as it is. I can’t even be myself around anyone either. I just feel like I’m never going to accomplish anything in life and might as well give up.

I care about them a lot. And I think that somehow they still care about me. They've said that the only reason they're still around is that they're afraid I'll hurt or kill myself if they're not there to stop me. I want to do what's best for them. Surely if I cut them out of my life, and avoid meeting new people, but I don't hurt myself, then they'll be happy and safe, and their fears will go unrealized. That has to be better than accidentally hurting everyone I care about over and over and over again.",not depression
"Could someone give me advice on finding a job? : I know I could post in a different sub-Reddit, but I feel more comfortable posting with people who will understand the struggles of finding a job with depression.
~Background~
I have social anxiety and I don’t have a lot of work experience, so finding a job has been very difficult for me. In a recent interview, I internally died when I had to shake a hand because my anxiety makes me palms sweaty! I’m trying to push myself out of my current routine of being a maid for my family and going to community college. I desperately want a proper job. I’m finally in a place where I have the courage to try.
~Issue~
Moving out of the major city I live in in less than four months. That’s when my lease ends and i have to move across the state because of family related things. I still want to find a job before then. Temporary would be best because four months isn’t a long time to get hired at a full time job. Should I go to a temp agency? Do they have work for a twenty year old like me?",not depression
"Severe depression on weekends but not during week, at wit's end? Stealing all my joy. : Hi all.
I'm 26, have a diagnosed mental disorder (I feel uncomfortable disclosing) and have been on medication for many years (mood stabilizers). I do not struggle with depression **in general** despite a very dysfunctional family that causes 99% of my stress. I cope very well in day to day life, even through the 3 weeks where my dad was close to dying in hospital this year. I have a very positive outlook and maintain a normal job which I am very successful at. I am also in a wonderful romantic relationship for 2 years and have a good friendship circle. All the boxes are ticked. 
But this is where things go wrong. On a weekend I find myself in such a black hole and specifically on Sundays. I can barely move on a Sunday. Yesterday I spent the entire day in a fog, I was unpleasant to be around, I could barely talk to my partner and I honestly just wanted to sleep. This is rinse and repeat every week for as long as I can remember. Now I know what you're thinking, is it my job? I can honestly say that is impossible because I am very happy at my job, it virtually has no stress components to me and during the week I am in SUCH a good, happy, upbeat positive mood. I don't dread going to work.  I don't worry about work ever. I leave work and don't think about it again or  have to.
But bloody hell, Saturday rolls by and I often like death. Sunday comes and I am suicidal all over again.  I know Sunday blues is a thing and it has crossed my mind but I don't know how to cope or change this? I try and make plans for Sundays but no matter what I do, I feel exhausted, tired, drained, sad, depressed. I can have the best day planned will all my favorite things and still feel like crap. It sometimes is the same on a Saturday too. I wake up excited for the weekend and it is just... shit. But then during the week I'm so happy?
It's starting to make me act very irritated towards my partner and I cannot figure out how to change this. I'm in good shape. I exercise a lot. But this fog... it comes on a weekend and goes away Monday.",not depression

Despite working out daily, keeping up on my online schooling daily, journalling daily, there was a void that I could not seem to fill. But today it is filled and I woke up without the urge to cry or go back to sleep! I’m proud, this is such a deep accomplishment and I am certain that I will wake up tomorrow and not feel that void before bed or immediately after waking up
I’m healing more and more every day from all my traumas, all my battles, everything and everyone who I have lost. I don’t blame myself today the way I did yesterday. Today I am just me, living my life, being productive and manifesting a better reality.

"Neurofibromatosis : Hi guys. I´m kinda new in this sub-reddit. 
Honestly, i came here for read most of things here and post sad/depressing stuff that happend to me. Well, this post its because i want to talk just a bit about my disease, and i would like to know if anyone in here have it and would like to chat. I have never in my whole life meet anyone with it before.
Its called Neurofibromatosis, for those who don´t know. There´s 3 types. 
Type 1.
Type 2.
 Scwannomatosis.
The type 2 and the ""Scwannomatosis"" are the worsts. I have type 1. It kinda give you random symptons. With the type 1 you can; (and don´t wanna offense anyone. but i´m not good with english tbh. lol) Retarded, have myopia, have deformities, scoliosis, and others stuff. In my case i have some deformities (because of my surgerys) myopia i´m not sure... bc i use glasses but i have never been told if its because of my disease. and i have scoliosis. I have been in surgery 2 times. 
The first one it was because i needed it. You know. But, after a while a dick-head hit me very hard and it got broken. So if i didn´t get surgery again i wouldn´t be able to walk again.
i´ve been growing up around people who don´t understand it. (My family does and support me. So. Cool) But, meanwhile some kids grew up with football and beating the shit between them. I grew up with my SEGA, or my old PC, or my ps2. So... i don´t complain. But i was kinda... different in school when i had to talk to them. Because i wasn´t able to just talk about to games or something. Because they were more like sports and stuff. 
So, I grew up with no friends. Until high school. 
High school was the worst. Bullyng, being alone most of the time, in the recesses, doing homework alone, or anything of school alone. Until one day i meet some good people. Who liked memes, shitposts, games, and stuff. 
(I have a post talking about how it went... and it was bad) So yeah. It was kinda crap growing up with this. Idk what to say tbh. I just want to meet anyone else with it to talk.

The past couple months have been really tough on me, going through a rough break up (maybe definitive, maybe not) and I feel like sadness and depressive thoughts just assault me anytime, and there is nothing I can do to control it.
So I decided to have a try with a mild, natural anti depressant called St John's Wort.
I did not need any prescription, I have been taking 2 pills a day for a week now. It kinda works, I still have the sadness outbursts, but I feel like they are less intense. I sleep kinda better, although I have vivid dreams that, sometimes, revolve around my (ex?) girlfriend,which sucks.

"Sat under my Desk, Having a Cry : As I'm typing this it is 00:47 am and I am a 21 year old man who is crying like a baby under his desk
So how did this happen. I was on my computer as usual, playing some Fallout 4. And, I looked at my drawing stuff sitting basically unused on my desk so I stick on some music and try to draw something. After an hour of drawing something, rubbing it out, trying again, over and over I was getting too angry, I had to stop.. Throwing my stuff onto the floor I open up YouTube to watch something funny to get my mood up. Find a video, open it, click play. I get ""Ethernet doesn't have a valid Ip configuration"". Boom no Internet on my pc.
So I spend the next hour trying every available solution I could find on my phone and nothing works.. And I can't just use WiFi because my USB dingle chose this time to break because when my stupid father was building this PC for me he said ""You don't need WiFi or Bluetooth relax""
So I try to tether my phone to my pc, it won't work, so that's when I climb under my desk to see if the plug is broken, and it's fine. And that is the point where I started to cry,  crying my stupid eyes out until I couldn't cry no more. I did IT at college and I can't fix my own stupid computer. I can't draw, I can't play games because I'm just terrible at those and have to cheat, I can't sleep, I can't even lay down properly, can't get a job, can't go outside, why the heck am I even here when I can't even handle one of my many devices not connecting to the Internet.

"What games do you play? : I assume a good chunk of us do some kind of gaming for escapism.  Just wondering maybe we can share what we play and perhaps, just maybe find others to play with or something? 
Also do you actually enjoy gaming? For me, especially the past 6 years or so, it's been very hard to enjoy. I find that trying to finish a game just becomes a chore, and I always feel guilty in some way, for not doing something ""better"" with my time, and even though I find it hard to enjoy, I always somehow manage to trick myself into thinking that this time will be different. And then 30 minutes in, I'm probably already bored lol.  So if you relate, maybe you can at least mention what was the last game you enjoyed (and how long ago if you want).
Anyway, last games I enjoyed were way back around this time last year, they were Titanfall 2 (campaign) and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. 
As of right now, I'm trying to get into Resident Evil 2 RE, played a bit of Halo: Anniversary on PC (I don't intend to finish just kinda revisiting some of it) and I tried my best to get through A Plague Tale: Innocence, but I just couldn't so I stopped. 
Then there's LoL which I started playing like 8 years ago, so it's one of those games I just kinda come back to here and there 
And last but not least, there's Magic the Gathering: Arena which is technically the most recent game I've enjoyed, which I started about a month ago...but it's just a card game so whatever I guess.
Anyway, feel free to share and I hope you're all doing okay :)",not depression

"Feeling useless and unwanted : The last couple years of my life have been horrible, I spent 2-3 years indoors with maybe all together 30 days outside in them 2-3 years, Ik you’ll think 'why didn’t u get a job' or 'go out and meet people' but there’s a lot of reasons behind that, 1 because I recently moved from a place I had everything I wanted because of something that it’s own post entirely, and I lost all my friends and the place I moved to I tried getting a job at a car wash and that did not last at all, so after I lost that job I completely felt utterly useless so I isolated myself even more, but recently I met someone, and this someone lives a couple hours from me but things started to get better, I’m on the verge of moving in with them and they’ve motivated me to find work, unfortunately that feeling of uselessness has gotten much much worse, I feel like if I say or do the wrong thing they’ll go off me and the thought of that breaks my heart because I’ve never had anyone like this before, recently we found out we was expecting a child and unfortunately she had a miscarriage and it’s completely broken us but none of us show it, I’ve tried talking about my feelings to her but it completely breaks me and I just can’t hold in tears, she is also trying to stay strong but it’s taking a major tole on her and since the miscarriage I’ve felt so depressed and useless Cus finally stuff was looking up and now I’m in constant fear that I’m going to lose this person and if that happened idk if I’d be able to go on any longer, Thank you for taking the time to read this I needed to get it off my chest",not depression

"Social Media Sucks. : Modern world sucks. I think that’s pretty Fucking obvious. The internet has ruined everything. You’re always subconsciously comparing yourself to everyone else online, it’s hard to accept the fact that you’re not the best looking, most skilled or the most talented person out there. Play guitar or cover song? Someone has already done it and 10x better than you. Have a new idea? Someone’s already done it! Think you look nice today? You’re not as attractive as 90% of the people you see. Simply impossible to compete or to even be noticed, much less appreciated. Because of this your self esteem is just raped but go to take a break from social media and all you’re doing is isolating yourself. Everyone is so connected it’s like we’ve all forgotten how to socialise in real life, at least I have I think. People would much rather text and stay home than to go out and play. 
It’s like a super-internet culture has completely overridden all local cultures and communities. There is nothing unique about an individual’s background anymore. We all act the same now on the internet that has us connected globally. Nobody seems to hold any inherent traditions or values. 
And all this fucking virtue signalling, why can’t you fake bastards Fucking stop? Legit nobody fucking cares how virtuous you are, how altruistic you are, you’re only making anti-racist, anti-homophobic posts to fuel your own narcissistic egos.

Its also worse when I see them talking to others but not me and it just feels like a punch.

And on that topic I want to say that everyone that has faced difficulties in life, weather it be through mental health of life circumstances has a bit of a darkness in their soul. And this darkness is a beautiful thing. 
I don't know if I'm just a bit fu*%*ed up but I find people who have not experienced pain and loss to be have less substance. Individuals who have had to pull themselves out of dark places have more character, more charm, more mystery. And in my experience these are the kind of people who are the most loyal in times of hardship.

The other day when I went to grab my charger from her room I saw post-it notes on her bedside table that had messages like ""everything will be ok"" and many more depressingly depressing notes. She was also almost crying the other day in the car for no reason. I think its because I haven't been trying in school as of recently. Also I have been upset because she's hiring like 6+ people to help me with various tasks that I don't need help with. 3 tutors, therapists, mindfulness person, planning person and much more. She's throwing so much money to help me with stuff I truly don't need help with. I think she thinks the more she throws at the situation the more I will care about school. She also sent me to live with my aunt and uncle for a few months. She was also upset because I snuck out to get vaccines since she's anti vax. I know she might be a little crazy but I still love her because she is my mom. Also a person I just don't like talking to. She's a single mom so all she has to talk to is me. She can be extremely argumentative. Her entire life she's gotten through because of the wealth of her parents and her immensely wealthy boyfriends. Every night tells me to go to bed and gives me a 45 minute warning, 30, etc. Watches over me like a hawk because it is literally all she has to do. I've never been able to get with a girl or hangout with new friends because I know she'll be watching me so close. Only time I was close to a girl we were hanging out after a dance at 1am and my mom had stayed awake for me. She threatened to come to her house if I did not come home immediately. The moment I can drive I plan on being home almost never because I don't like it. This will probably make her depression worse. What should I do?",not depression

"Why is it that talking to people about depression is so hard? : Heyo everyone. I'm usually a chipper person outwardly in my day-to-day life. It's all a facade, of course, but I feel like a lot of folks with depression do the same. I'm constantly telling people to be positive, giving career advice, and overall trying to be a decent person for my wife, kids, and co-workers (not my friends, as I have literally none since I graduated college).

Keeping with that, why do I have such a problem talking to my wife about my depression? I feel stupid for complaining about my anxiety over money, debt, and bills. I feel like I'm just bitching when I complain about having to work from home because of a sleep disorder I have. I know I'm a hypocrite when I say ""I need to lose weight"" and then just have absolutely no motivation to actually do it. I whinge about how much my job makes me want to just kill myself but then stick with it because ""It pays the bills."" 

I just make excuses for everything and whinge about everything which leads to me just trying to keep it inside instead. My doctor told me the other day that my sleep apnea (not the disorder I mentioned, that's another one) is extremely severe because I'm so overweight; why don't I just lose the weight? I couldn't bring myself to answer with ""because I'm an unmotivated fat fuck that values my life less than I value the brief happiness I get from drinking soda.""

It's behaviour that we know is self-destructive and I don't want to think I'm the only person that keeps everything bottled up. It leads to days where I'm just really on edge and I feel like even more of a burden than I usually do. The only reason I keep going is because my family needs me for money at this point.

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate

"I will probably end it when my mum isn't around anymore. : I can say with certainty that I have tried hard to make my life one worth living but my ongoing depression is more present and crippling than ever recently.

I would never do anything while my mum is still alive because I know she wouldn't cope. I'm her only daughter and we are very close. But I'm clueless as to how to live with this fog that has followed me since my teenage years, especially if I don't have her in my life.

It's as if the depression becomes heavier the older I get, despite the sertraline and hours and hours of therapy. I just can't see myself living a long and fulfilled life.",moderate
"Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April.

Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections.

I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know.

Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.,moderate
"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent...",moderate

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months.

Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.,moderate
"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent...",moderate

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

"2019 was my worst year with 2 depression crisis. I'm happy it ended but so afraid of what 2020 will bring. : This years was rough. It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again.

"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",moderate

But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to.

"Another shitty new year. : I think it's fair to say that the past few years (since 2014 or so) each year got gradually worse and worse. Now here we are. 2020. I'm at an all-time high of depression, loneliness, and other issues I won't bore you with. Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore. Let's all hope that 2020 brings on new opportunities and new positivity into all our lives. I invite anybody to take a shot with me as the clock strikes midnight.

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",moderate
"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate

"parents suck : I’m very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn’t really affect me except for with my family. I’m not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me.

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state.

In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

"2019 was my worst year with 2 depression crisis. I'm happy it ended but so afraid of what 2020 will bring. : This years was rough. It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again.

"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",moderate

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",moderate

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

"I wasted an entire decade. : Back in 2010, I thought by now I would have my shit together. A career, a degree, true love, *something.* Instead, I'm in the same place I was back then, except my youth is officially over. I'm turning 30 this year. Everyone my age is settling down and staying inside. Soon, my body will give out on me too. I used to be a fat kid, but I've gotten a lot more active in the past couple years. What's the point if I'm just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? I'm finally serious about going to college, but the only way I can afford it is if I abuse the shit out of myself. I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.) Even my personal taste is becoming ""old people."" According to posts from r/starterpacks and elsewhere, things I like such as indie music, craft beer and tattoos are apparently ""insufferable pretentious yuppie boomer millennial shit"" now. I feel like I'm becoming Grandpa Simpson: ""I used to be with 'it', but then they changed what 'it' was. Now what I'm with isn't 'it' anymore and what’s 'it' seems weird and scary.

scared of hurting myself if i get drunk : so i turn 18 in a couple of days and it feels fucking weird saying that because when i was 13 i could not imagine my life past 16 or 17 and it’s very hard to wrap my head around that i’m actually here right now despite how much i wish i wasn’t. to celebrate my bday a small group of friends and i are having a party but i’m terrified to let myself get properly drunk. i’ve only drunk alcohol once or twice and have only gotten a bit tipsy for me that meant more friendly loud singing coming out of my shell. but that same night i only had 3ish drinks i found myself in my friends bathroom looking for something to sh with and just sitting on the floor spacing out. as much as i do want to die i don’t want to do in a way that’s harmful to my friends but i do wanna get drunk and force myself to have fun bc that’s what you’re supposed to do. but i just have this gut feeling that i will do something about ending my life if i drink a bunch bc the only thing now stopping me is just the courage and that’s literally the only thing alcohol gives me. i don’t really know what the point of posting this is it’s just a vent but maybe if anyone else has dealt w this,moderate

Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it’s been very hard trying to get him a job (he’s 24 and it’s all he asks about). He’s even been asking me if he can live with me when i’m older and ready to move out of my moms house. It’s all just too much and i don’t even know where my heads at.

"Jeez, looking back at the decade is horribly depressed. From 15 to 25, almost NOTHING changed for the good. : I believe I dropped out of high school when I was 15 or 16, not sure when. I got my GED instead then that was it. 

Slowly but surely lost all my friends over that time, but somehow got a girlfriend during that time whom I've been with for almost 7 years now. Sometimes I feel I put too much dependency on her. 

Anyway, I just feel that at my age I should be somewhere else. I still live with my dad, I never went to college, I don't have friends, I've lost all social skills I used to have. Any time I'm around people (which is really fucking rare) I shut down and can't connect so I stay inside like always. 

This new year I plan to go to community college when he spring semester starts but I'm worried I'll bail out of it like I usually do.

Even though these feelings are fleeting, almost momentary, they have been more and more present and appearing frequently. 

I have gone through a bad breakup a few months ago, I got rear ended by a truck and was forced to get a new car, and I moved to a new apartment and had to buy essentially all new furniture. So I understand that I am also in a period of transition and that could certainly effect my mindset.

"Considering trying to get antidepressants. Scare to start and worried about weight gain. : I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression (moderately high functioning though) and anxiety but I didn’t have the right kind of insurance to do anything about it. I’ve got a primary doctor picked out (haven’t had one in like five years) and a therapist picked out. I just can’t work up the guts to make the appointments. I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll talk to the doctor about it and they’ll deny me getting antidepressants and that therapy won’t help. If I try and it fails then that’s the final nail in the coffin, there’s no hope because I tried so much already. 

And there’s the looming possible weight gain. I’m 5’3” female and 205lbs. I went from a very fit 142lbs (26% body fat) in 2015 to 205lbs (42% body fat) and out of shape now. I know how to eat well and I love exercising but I just can’t anymore. I despise how I look already so being super depressed sounds better than continuing to gain weight. 

How am I supposed to walk into a new doctor and be like “hey, doc. I’m super depressed and anxious as fuck. How about some antidepressants? Oh and none that’ll make me gain weight. K thanks.” (Obviously I would be more professional, I’m just making jokes as coping.)",moderate

I know, it’s stupid, but yeah it’s about a girl. basically I’m in a whole new province for my winter break (still a high school student) and the girl I’ve been talking to is staying at home for the break which is where I normally live. I’ve only gotten to communicate with her through Snapchat and it went well for a bit until I told her about my feelings and she said that she kind of felt the same way about me but there was also someone else. a week and a half have gone by and I’ve noticed as the days continue she loses more interest in me. I’m pretty sure she’s into the other guy now who happens to be one of her exes. It’s just been making me sad because when I like a girl I really really like her and it’s hard for me to stop. that’s why when they don’t like me bad I have a hard time coping with the fact that they don’t like me back. this girl I like is special in many ways I could honestly go on forever and describe how perfect she is. that’s why it’s hard knowing she doesn’t like me. she’s going to a New Years party in my hometown with the guy she likes and I’m not sure what’s gonna happen, it’s just been irritating me very much, I have no one to talk to. I’m in a huge hotel with my family and they’re all drunk, my friends are either busy or at parties, I’ve come to this chat to talk, I feel kinda pathetic for some reason. anyways, that’s how I’m going to end my decade. feeling depressed about a girl that’s in a different province than me. very pathetic. hopefully someone that’s either dumb enough to want to listen to my story or is just curious to read this or for some reason ends up reading all of this, hopefully they can say something back, I just want to hear something from someone that isn’t my own conscious. now I’m just getting vibes that I want to badly die, I know I’m not suicidal but I just want life to stop for a very long time so I can have a break from everything. that’s about all I had to say, it’s New Years in 2 minutes. again hopefully someone sees this. happy New Years to everyone that sees this and everyone in general I guess. goodnight",moderate

 i don't wanna feel happy at this point, so no meds for me. reality sucks, and i just have to get used to facing it everyday. i question if this reality isn't hell, because sometimes it feels like life is just out to get me. i sometimes worry about going to hell, but what if this is hell? 

the funny thing is that i dont mean jack shit. theres 7 billion people here. not to mention in the observable universe i am literally just a speck. however my brain doesn't see it like this. life is a huge mind-fuck. x  10000000000000000000",moderate

"2020, New Year, New Nothing special : This year has been my worst year and to be honest I dont even remember the first 6 months and all the years before it, just a smudge and small memories, but what I do remember is it being a hateful, depressing, anxiety fueled life, my ex keeps wanting me back, my brother is a pos, my mom is always angry, I'm always sad angry and overworked, nothing has gone right 

But I dont have the ""2020! New year new me! Resolutions! New life!"" Emotion, I just feel 
Oh it's a new decade, 2020, cool

But for some reason I just have a pit of sadness 
Everywhere I look its ""2019 was amazing, so much joy, so much life, love, everything!"" But nothing has happened to me

"Overwhelmed by how little I feel : I've become emotionally numb to the sorts of moments that seemingly used to be exempt from my depression and it's creating this antsy discomfort in me during moments like watching the new year's ball drop where I expect to have a brief respite and instead just continue to feel nothing.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense.",moderate

"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate

"Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.",moderate

Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.,moderate
"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try...

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months.

I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",moderate

I read the self help books and I know it’s my fault. Again I can’t kill myself but if i could, it would be for that reason. I’m not suicidal nor do I want to die, but I can’t get out of this downward spiral. I know there’s no hope no cure. Depression is situationally brought on.

"My family loves me, but I hate myself. : I have always been a smart, optimistic child. I was one of the best at my school. I always made everyone proud.
But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now. I guess I just have to go through these two weeks.

"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent.",moderate

"Another shitty new year. : I think it's fair to say that the past few years (since 2014 or so) each year got gradually worse and worse. Now here we are. 2020.

Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while.

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",moderate
"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

This new year I plan to go to community college when he spring semester starts but I'm worried I'll bail out of it like I usually do. 

I don't know, I just feel fucking old and like I'm wasting my youth.  

I want to make this next decade better, I'm optimistic but I can't help look at the past and wonder what could have been.",moderate
"Alone on Nye (another holiday) again : I'm so tired of being alone all the time. I'm trying to be a good person, meet peoole, do things. And just like my 30th birthday earlier this past year I'm alone again. I've reached out to people and been ghosted I've asked and been told one thing and then they disappear. I've asked on Facebook, I've looked online. And that's it just another Nye alone by myself without a single fuck from anyone. It's hard enough dealing with depression and not using as it is.

"New Years Eve. Woo. : I'm pretty good on keeping my depression under wraps. I can feel joy and I'm usually not super depressed, but its honestly got to me today.

I have a few Best Friends. Two here, and one in Chicago. I can't go to Chicago, obviously, seeing that I live hours away. The other two are at parties of their own, and I haven't gotten a text from the one in Chicago. 

I feel very alone. And its scares me. I feel like a pansy saying that, seeing that I'm such a big guy with a lot of care. I want to tell them ""Hey I'm not doing very well."" But they're all drunk or high and I can't actually get my thoughts across to them.

"How do I know if I have depression? : I’m confused because I display symptoms of depression such as a loss in motivation for some activities, wanting to nap constantly (never took naps before), less of an appetite, feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, can’t catch a break, will never be good enough, despair. Even though these feelings are fleeting, almost momentary, they have been more and more present and appearing frequently. 

I have gone through a bad breakup a few months ago, I got rear ended by a truck and was forced to get a new car, and I moved to a new apartment and had to buy essentially all new furniture. So I understand that I am also in a period of transition and that could certainly effect my mindset. 

I was looking for some guidance or personal experience that may help shed some light on how I feel or why I feel this way.

"I sometimes feel like it’s not depression : Keep in mind I’ve not been diagnosed but its pretty cookie cutter depression. But recently I’ve really been thinking about it and I’m just so sensitive and I don’t really know how to stop it. I will flip my lid over things I’m not even upset over. I’ll have breakdowns about something and then be perfectly fine after. It just feels like I’m not in control of my emotions but not to the extent of bipolar? It’s been this way since I was a kid and the strongest emotion has always either been anger or soul crushing sadness. 

I’ve tried meditations and all that self help shit but it’s so on the spot idk how to stop it from happening. It really runs my life because I don’t ever leave my comfort zone or its a guaranteed meltdown. I want to live again. I don’t wanna be upset all the fucking time. 

I want to know I’ll come home watch some tv like I knew I wanted instead of dissociating halfway through the first episode and all of a sudden hit a low because I’m by myself. How dare I be by myself, even tho that’s all I want all day.

My grandmother almost died again. I spent Christmas alone. My ex got a new girlfriend, and I don't care much about that, but more about the fact that as a friend, I apparently no longer exist to him.

Divorce might be plausible but without money, I could lose my son and I can not let that happen.

Today was probably one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was really looking forward to hanging out and partying with my friends for new years but idk they didnt want to party they wanted to play playstation which is fine I guess but idk we're in our 20s it's new years eve we always used to party but idk so basically I ended up spending it by myself and on top of that I got some weed thinking that would definetly make it better but got either the worst mid ever or some straight cbd bud idk its trash though I know that for sure, but idk for some reason after today and how it went like it just pushed to the point of that's it like I'm done with these people and I wont talk to them anymore, I'm starting all the way over and I'll try to make new friends or whatever, I deleted all my social media theres literally no way for anyone besides my family which is my grandma mom and 2 brothers to contact me. Ive just had a shitty day, but theres a backstory to it, I've always been not necessarily depressed but I usually feel kind of a mix of down and lonely extremely lonely for sure. Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",moderate

Maybe its laziness. The only concrete hobby i have is the internet.   Soon winter break will be over and I'm going to half to pretend like i am super energetic, cause i lied about it in the first place. People often complain about my unresponsiveness to stuff, they ask if i need help. But it's not a cut and dry (that the saying?) answer. Do i need help? Am i being overdramatic? I am probably not mentally ill. Delete if necessary.

But I still hurt so much. I miss my ex, I miss my old friends, I miss not being alone all of the time.

I just wish I could get a job, but employers only look at applications for an average of 3 seconds before making a decision, and I have no work experience, so I immediately go in the trash. I am worthless and I cannot ever be anything else.

"2019 was the worst year of my life : I’m so glad 2019 is over because it was the year that i started cutting, i lost my four of my best friends who i’ve known for years, my mental health and feelings of worthlessness got worse than they ever had, i’ve been doing shit in school because my depression sucks all fucking energy and motivation out of me, i came out to my friends only for them to make fun of me and call me a faggot, my grandmother passed away and i talked to some of my friends about my mental issues hoping it would help only for them to get mad at me for making them “deal with my shit” and now they make fun of me for cutting my arms, they’ve also stopped inviting me to hang out with them and finding out they’re all together and never even told me really hurt. The worst fucking thing of all was my close friend and one of the only people i trust because he was actually supportive of me when i came out to him and told him about my problems moved to a different country and he invited all of us to hang out with him one more time but i missed it because i was out sick from school and didn’t use my phone so he had no way of contacting me which i feel really fucking guilty about and i missed what could have actually been a nice fucking day.

This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don’t want to read it or can’t make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.

So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn’t the most surprising fact you’ve heard all day. But I’m a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it’s because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

TLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important",moderate

"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate

"parents suck : I’m very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn’t really affect me except for with my family. I’m not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we’re currently in and spent the night outside (we’re on a ski vacation, it get’s below -15°C here at night). Said I have to go to therapy for being annoyed (I’ve went to therapy before, it really did not work for me). My mother joined in and asked why I couldn’t just be a normal child.

"Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it.

Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.,moderate
"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent...",moderate

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

"2019 was my worst year with 2 depression crisis. I'm happy it ended but so afraid of what 2020 will bring. : This years was rough. It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again.

"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",moderate

But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to.

I'm at an all-time high of depression, loneliness, and other issues I won't bore you with. Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore. Let's all hope that 2020 brings on new opportunities and new positivity into all our lives. I invite anybody to take a shot with me as the clock strikes midnight. We may not be celebrating together in person, but that shot will bring us all together for that split moment. Cheers, and happy New Year everybody.",moderate

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",moderate
"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

The therapist I see more told me my dad was abusive but I felt weird about it so I denied it. I haven’t seen my dad in two years so I’ve been visiting my dad and family for the last two weeks. I see him treating my siblings the way he treated me and any small thing I do, such as telling him I’m hungry, angers him to the point of raising his voice and accusing me of lying. My old feelings and depression symptoms are back. I feel like life is a waste because my depression isn’t situational, everyone’s life is worse when I’m around despite people telling me the opposite I think they’re lying, I’m pathologically crying again (I won’t think about anything that makes me sad and but I’ll start crying), and I have no appetite.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense.",moderate

I know my wife sees it, she’s called me out on it, but I shrug it off and say I’m tired. I love my family but right now I feel just feel drained.

Its not like anyone checks up on me. The only thing stopping me is my best friend would think its her fault. Noone deserves to be the person that couldve been there to save you right.

I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",moderate

"New decade, hopefully new me : So as of starting this it’s 6 minutes into the new decade and I feel things have been on a very downward trajectory for me. I can’t remember a time when I’ve felt happy while sober so that has been nothing new but recently I’ve noticed my social anxiety getting worse and worse. I’ve stopped making any effort to hang out with my friends, I’ve been putting off going to buy something I need because I’m afraid of interacting with people at the store, and the weirdest thing is I am now pee shy which is something I haven’t struggled with before. I’m going to college next year and I’m worried that if I can’t make progress getting over my social anxiety that I won’t interact with anyone at my school. I passed up invitations to New Years parties and told several friends that I was out of town instead of hanging out. I don’t know what I’m hoping to accomplish by posting this but at the very least it will be nice to have said it at least once.",moderate

"If you don’t want to read this, you don’t have to. I’m just using this as a cathartic rant on the internet. : You know how people write letters and then burn them for catharsis?

This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don’t want to read it or can’t make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.

So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn’t the most surprising fact you’ve heard all day. But I’m a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it’s because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

TLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important",moderate

"Worst new years ever : So much for the pomp and circumstance that's supposed to be 2020.

He was the love of my life, but he had changed his mind about me I guess. I remember everything from our relationship but he said that I was being delusional. Basically that I've been wrong about everything.

I always encouraged him and he never encouraged me. Being with him brought my depression back. I hurt myself because of him. Physically and emotionally. He left me at a time where I really needed a friend.

Do I still feel sad and empty? Yeah. Am I still depressed as fuck? Yep! But at least I have one less asshole stopping me from achieving my full potential.  

I'm tired of being walked all over. I'm tired of people using me because I'm nice. It only makes my depression worse. I don't want to be hurt anymore.

"Fuck this. : I’m using Siri to write this because I just don’t have the energy to write it myself. Everyone hates this holiday I’m not unique in thinking that. And actually I was having a pretty good New Year’s. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn’t at all. I know it’s just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We’re perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don’t like, rather another place I really don’t like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I’d see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn’t wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn’t want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me. Just so you’re aware I have a history with severe depression and anxiety, this isn’t out of nowhere, although it is my first time posting about it so there is probably a lot of missing nuance and backstory. I’ll probably believe this at some point, but right now I truly just hate myself and everyone around me. Truly the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last few months has been my semi new puppy. I really think that if I had assurances that she would have a happy life without me, I do it tomorrow.",moderate
"Cried my way into 2020 : I was talking to my friend and I said how I was left alone for new years and said how i hated it and was upset/depressed. I told him i had cried earlier and was upset that i was so lonely, but i put a clown emoji and a peace sign with it to not have it be that serious, cuz I'm a train wreck and had to make it lighthearted somehow. He replied with ""you can go snapchat *[insert my ex's name here]*"" in a serious tone and I started crying then got mad since I blatantly told him i was sad/depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a ""lighthearted mood"" to the conversation. Then he acts like he's the victim because he was insanely insensitive.

So i'm starting the new year at rock bottom, and it can either go up (probably not), stay the same (most likely), or I'll die and be done with it (least likely cuz I'm a wimp).",moderate

"Can anyone relate. struggling : First time posting on reddit. yay 

Things in my life are getting to the point where it feels like a mountain of experiences are pressing me down and I feel like I can’t breathe or handle any stress without breaking down and crying all the time. I feel ok for short periods and then all of a sudden, whoosh - it’s like a wave knocks my feet out and pulls me underwater for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve gone to therapy and most of the time I feel better for a couple hours afterward and then it goes right back to this dark heaviness. I feel hopeless and like I can’t relate to a lot of people in the city which is why I’ve temporary located back to this small town where I spent some time a few years ago..

highlight reel:

-mentally disabled older brother + emotionally unavailable/blocked parents (who never explained what was wrong with him until I asked when I was 14. We didn’t talk/hug/ate dinner maybe 4x/year together. lot of anger and talking behind each other’s backs since I can remember-mostly my dad doing this. 

-close family friend (like an uncle to me) drunk drove off a ridge and killed himself when I &amp; his son was 13 (close childhood friend) who then later accidentally killed himself of a meth overdose when we were 19/20 

-a year prior ^^ my best childhood friend was killed in a car accident and it felt like nobody I knew could relate 

-dislocated left shoulder 6 times over 7 years, had surgery when 16 &amp; 22, but the guy who did the first operation messed it up and screwed up my shoulder/drilled too much into my bone. felt like I didn’t have a say as my parents decided it at the time and I went into a super dark depression afterward. chronic pain in both shoulders and neck. feel like I’m 70 sometimes always thinking about my body  

-been sexually assaulted like 5 times, was held down and choked while someone came inside me in the back of a minivan. another time was roofied and woke up naked in a bed of a guy I had no clue who he was and how I got there, couldn’t remember anything. passed out drunk in my bed another time after party I organized at home and woke up to a friend’s friend having anal sex with me. etc. Recent turn of events has me reliving the most recent one and it makes me feel so worthless and like it’s all my fault esp since it was so painful and has affected me the most. sometimes I feel like I hate my body

-on that note I seem to keep attracting guys who aren’t patient or sensitive enough to take things slow and I keep getting hurt by things moving too fast even when I keep saying that I need gentle progression/mega trust first but I feel like I’m just continuing to lose hope at genuinely connecting with anyone. I get attention from guys who tell me I’m cute/smart but I feel so detached from my body, like cardboard. feel hopeless and scared to trust men

-I know I’m not fat but feel like I am always criticizing my body, I look in the mirror and see huge hips and I tell myself I’m “too big” and take up too much space and my butt’s not big enough, etc. From being told I was too skinny as a little girl and then gaining weight after 1st surgery. Troubling? thing is now I weigh 139, I’m 5’10, which means I haven’t weighed this little since I was like 14. I’ve been told multiple times by guys I’ve dated that I’m hot and sometimes I look at myself and think, whoa I’m super skinny what am I talking about, And then it goes right back to critic eyes and it seems like everything I wear makes me look huge. also, as a performer in college, I got a lot of feedback to be skinnier and it feels like it’s permanently affected how I see myself. Like it’s a good thing if I go a day without eating even though I know that’s not healthy. does anyone relate??

-survived a mass shooting at work this year and now I feel like the ptsd is making me insane. It got better and then it got worse. I’m scared to go out grocery shopping for too long, I couldn’t even go out tonight because of all the fireworks sound like gunshots and I still feel like I’m in a state of shock 

-Student debt’s only close to like $40k but I got an arts degree and now just feel screwed after having taken time off for this 2nd shoulder operation and feeling so insecure/doubting myself &amp; my abilities to do anything “productive” // “of worth” with my life. 

-climate change extinction you know the drill

Everything just feels pointless and I have such a lack of motivation to do most things. Even the littlest things take so much energy. I feel like I can’t even talk to people for extended periods of time because I just want to lie down or be alone

"I hate this month : I hate January. With a passion. I've been in bed every available minute since Christmas, dreading it. It's stupid to dwell, and I know it, but I can't stop.

I lost my grandmother, who practically raised me and was my mother as a child, in January. She was the glue that held my family together. We lost her, and we fell apart. My mom and uncle both divorced their respective partners, there were unrepairable rifts caused, and members moved hours away. I haven't seen or spoken to my uncle in a decade. I barely see my cousins, who were basically my sisters growing up. I got so mad at my grandfather, the biggest father figure I had, over revelations made after her death that I didn't speak to him for years. We've since reconnected, but it's not like it was. My mom and I have grown a lot closer in the wake, but I've lost the nearness of everyone else. 

I nearly died in January. My ex-husband was abusive, and we fought... He strangled me with a power cord until I blacked out not even 5 feet away from our sleeping 6 month old. He was arrested. 

The court system basically told me that my life wasn't worth shit. He was out of jail in 4 days on ""time served."" He moved in with his 8 month pregnant girlfriend and turned off my electricity. He broke into my apartment on numerous occasions, despite my protective order. I tried to have something done about it, and his command threatened harm to me and to my career. I went to my own command and was beaten down verbally - they not only threatened my career, but did everything they could to me that couldn't be traced back to that incident. I had to look over my shoulder for months because there were people quite literally out to get me, waiting for the smallest slip up so they could Captain's Mast me. I ended up having a nervous breakdown in a doctor's office, and he quite possibly saved my life by helping me get discharged from the military. 

Two years ago today, a friend I grew up with, my best friend's little brother who became my other best friend and my very first love, killed himself. His wife alienated him from every one of his friends, got pissed and screamed at him and me when we tried to catch up via text a few years ago - years after they had gotten married and we had both moved on with life. So when he posted on Facebook basically begging for someone to talk to two years and two days ago, I ignored it. I didn't want to be responsible for bringing more shit to his life when she got pissed again. Apparently, they were having issues (again) and she had threatened to leave him and take his kids. She was packing bags. He took his life. 

It's hard to know how to feel. I've been struggling with it for years now. We hadn't seen each other in a decade. Hadn't spoken in years because the wife was very possessive and jealous. I kept my distance. But, he was a HUGE part of my childhood. We were dating off and on for probably the better part of 6 years. He was my first love, and I still cared about him and his family. They were my family too - I still talk to them. His sister is still a friend, though we grew apart thanks to geography and crappy husbands. I saw his mom a couple days ago, she hugged me, said she missed me, told me to come over soon. I live two blocks away, but I can't bring myself to go to that house. I feel like I have more sorrow and grief over him being gone than I'm entitled to. It makes it worse because I feel guilty for it. I don't know how much I'm allowed to feel, so I don't show much of anything and I've spent two years on the edge of boiling over from holding it in. I really fucking miss just knowing he was out there somewhere, with his goofy grin and his laughing eyes. He was always so happy, always laughing and smiling. I can't reconcile that with someone in a place so dark. And I guess that's part of my grief, too. Knowing that the world took that spark of life away from him and crushed him so thoroughly. It absolutely breaks my heart. 

But worst of all about January ... I was born and with every passing year, I'm reminded how little I've achieved with my life thus far. I'll be 33, I just finally got financially stable. And all I can think about is how miserable I am. 

I stayed up while the kids did for the new year hype, but I can't sleep now. My mom's dog is sleeping over here tonight. He's snuggly, where my dog isn't at all. So, he's asleep with his head on my stomach and I'm laying here with tears rolling down my face, trying not to disturb him. But I needed to get this out somewhere. It's probably an incoherent mess, but I feel a little lighter. 

But seriously... 
I really fucking hate January.",moderate

"2020 is the year I take a stand against depression. : Depression is a greedy soab. It takes far too much time, far too many lives. It ruins relationships with families, spouses, friends... It ruins the mind of those it afflicts. Treatment is a long process, with so many wrong roads to go down. 

I have tried pills; many kinds. I have tried therapy many times. The depression I have is something I can't fix with these things, I have learnt this. It took over 10 years to figure it out but better late than never. And while there may be no true end to it, I've found the best way to get over feeling depressed (in my case) is to actively rebel against it. 

""I don't want to cook dinner, I'll just have toast.""   
""I can't go for a walk, it's too cold.""   
""I don't feel like doing anything."" etc etc... You know the drill I'm sure.

But you know what, depression? Fuck you. I may not be motivated to do anything at all right now but out of sheer spite, as a complete middle finger to this horrible mental affliction... I'm going to prove you wrong. You do not own me.",moderate

I feel like no one cares. My best friend was my girlfriend and we broke up just before Christmas so i don’t even know who to talk to anymore. Not to mention she’s already out with other guys. I’m just lost. I have no true friends. It’s just a mirage. I go to my classes and do my work, but that’s about it.

"Happy new year : Never posted in here before, 2019 was quite a year of loneliness.

Never been one to be invited to parties as much as I socialize and try to make more friends. but a friend invited me to one last minute tonight. So I showed up but only familiar faces of a class that graduated before me and who had no idea who I was so I looked for my friend and he was on the side of the house throwing up. Grabbed him some waters and a few napkins and left. Spent 40 minutes driving around by my self listening to music.

The local late night pizza place gave me my order for free because they see me there all the time... While I appreciate it of course, when I got back home I just lost it.. like I never have before, I guess it was just the finality of new years coming to pass and the only person who gave a shit about me, who even had some genuine care about me was the guy at the pizza place.

"So depressed that I've stopped sleeping... : I've been so depressed recently that I have stopped sleeping. It isn't intentional. My body just won't get tired until it's on the 36th hour. I have to stay up all night just to be able to sleep the next. It's not just my body. It's my mind as well. My mind just races, and even when it isn't racing, it's just this gentle but painful ""hum"" that is horribly consistent.

I slept last night...finally. I realized why my mind might be fighting it as well. When I wake up..? I am horrible. I'm waking up to a reality that I refuse to believe in. I wake up to find that all of my ambition (which I had to fight so hard the previous day to obtain) is now gone... I wake up ready to bite anybody's head off, and I have. I've had people text me to ask if I'm alright, and I've said ""Fuck you, fuck off,"" and then proceed to lie to them about whatever they ask before putting my phone down for the day and ignoring all the beeps. Now that I type that last word, I'm realizing that I should just put it on silent, or have it off altogether. I'll start by silencing it, though turning it off completely wouldn't be much of a loss to me. I use it to check the time (as my wristwatch is broken), but other than that, I don't need it.

I really want to sleep tonight.

I have a LOT of hope and a LOT of will to live. That's why this post isn't in the r/SuicideWatch subreddit. Sometimes though, I feel that way, not gonna lie... I may have a lot of hope and will to live, but I have a near equal amount of depression, anxiety, regret, and just overall negative emotion that eat away at me each and every day. Sometimes they are much more powerful, and I'm not quite sure how I survive when that happens. This is becoming harder.

"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate

Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts.

I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that.

Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset.

"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.

I can't take going to school, not talking to anyone then coming back home, unmotivated to do anything, just watching pointless videos and daydreaming about stuff that's never going to happen. 

I miss the times when I told people that I had no friends, but I actually had people who cared about me. Now what I once said is actual reality. I miss being able to share my thoughts with someone. It somehow gave me the drive to battle the things life threw at me.

So I am sitting at home, alone and I just feel empty again, like so often. It's like this physical black hole in my chest that sucks in all my energy. I have this very often, especially when I am not distracted by anything. 
In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

"2019 was my worst year with 2 depression crisis. I'm happy it ended but so afraid of what 2020 will bring. : This years was rough. It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again. During all of these I had to leave university for the year as I couldn't deal with the pression at the time.

"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",moderate

But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to.

Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees.

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",moderate
"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

A career, a degree, true love, *something.* Instead, I'm in the same place I was back then, except my youth is officially over. I'm turning 30 this year. Everyone my age is settling down and staying inside. Soon, my body will give out on me too. I used to be a fat kid, but I've gotten a lot more active in the past couple years. What's the point if I'm just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? I'm finally serious about going to college, but the only way I can afford it is if I abuse the shit out of myself. I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.)

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense.",moderate

On top of that they force me to go to events I don’t want to relaying with religion. And not so long ago I spoke out to a counselor they use to abuse me. They closed the case after 2 weeks.

I’m done. I don’t want to kill my self because I believe in my religion and that killing myself will only put me in a darker place. I’m just in a state of mind where I want to die in my sleep peacefully no pain included.

Its not like anyone checks up on me. The only thing stopping me is my best friend would think its her fault. Noone deserves to be the person that couldve been there to save you right.

Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",moderate

If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

TLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important",moderate

"Worst new years ever : So much for the pomp and circumstance that's supposed to be 2020. I know a lot of you are also having a bad day today as well, and I'm not comparing wounds here but the last two New Years Eve I've had was spent talking over skype or discord with my ex boyfriend, but yesterday he basically told me he wanted to start fresh with someone new and blocked/deleted me from everything. He was the love of my life, but he had changed his mind about me I guess. I remember everything from our relationship but he said that I was being delusional. Basically that I've been wrong about everything.

I always encouraged him and he never encouraged me. Being with him brought my depression back. I hurt myself because of him. Physically and emotionally. He left me at a time where I really needed a friend.

Do I still feel sad and empty? Yeah. Am I still depressed as fuck? Yep! But at least I have one less asshole stopping me from achieving my full potential.  

I'm tired of being walked all over. I'm tired of people using me because I'm nice. It only makes my depression worse. I don't want to be hurt anymore.

"Fuck this. : I’m using Siri to write this because I just don’t have the energy to write it myself. Everyone hates this holiday I’m not unique in thinking that. And actually I was having a pretty good New Year’s. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn’t at all. I know it’s just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We’re perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don’t like, rather another place I really don’t like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I’d see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn’t wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn’t want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me. Just so you’re aware I have a history with severe depression and anxiety, this isn’t out of nowhere, although it is my first time posting about it so there is probably a lot of missing nuance and backstory. I’ll probably believe this at some point, but right now I truly just hate myself and everyone around me. Truly the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last few months has been my semi new puppy. I really think that if I had assurances that she would have a happy life without me, I do it tomorrow.",moderate
"Cried my way into 2020 : I was talking to my friend and I said how I was left alone for new years and said how i hated it and was upset/depressed. I told him i had cried earlier and was upset that i was so lonely, but i put a clown emoji and a peace sign with it to not have it be that serious, cuz I'm a train wreck and had to make it lighthearted somehow. He replied with ""you can go snapchat *[insert my ex's name here]*"" in a serious tone and I started crying then got mad since I blatantly told him i was sad/depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a ""lighthearted mood"" to the conversation. Then he acts like he's the victim because he was insanely insensitive.

So i'm starting the new year at rock bottom, and it can either go up (probably not), stay the same (most likely), or I'll die and be done with it (least likely cuz I'm a wimp).",moderate

Me having lost everything.. thought this is my way out.. maybe just maybe I could help someone and lose my life in the process. So we walked over to her and he left one of the kids that wasn’t his in a crib. And stole her car with the other new born which was hers and his together. On top of this he was drunk as well. So she called the cops. So I stayed till the cops left and her family came to get her. Now that I’m relaxed and clear minded I was so selfish to wanna use someone else problem to solve me own.

"Can anyone relate. struggling : First time posting on reddit. yay 

Things in my life are getting to the point where it feels like a mountain of experiences are pressing me down and I feel like I can’t breathe or handle any stress without breaking down and crying all the time. I feel ok for short periods and then all of a sudden, whoosh - it’s like a wave knocks my feet out and pulls me underwater for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve gone to therapy and most of the time I feel better for a couple hours afterward and then it goes right back to this dark heaviness. I feel hopeless and like I can’t relate to a lot of people in the city which is why I’ve temporary located back to this small town where I spent some time a few years ago..

highlight reel:

-mentally disabled older brother + emotionally unavailable/blocked parents (who never explained what was wrong with him until I asked when I was 14. We didn’t talk/hug/ate dinner maybe 4x/year together. lot of anger and talking behind each other’s backs since I can remember-mostly my dad doing this. 

-close family friend (like an uncle to me) drunk drove off a ridge and killed himself when I &amp; his son was 13 (close childhood friend) who then later accidentally killed himself of a meth overdose when we were 19/20 

-a year prior ^^ my best childhood friend was killed in a car accident and it felt like nobody I knew could relate 

-dislocated left shoulder 6 times over 7 years, had surgery when 16 &amp; 22, but the guy who did the first operation messed it up and screwed up my shoulder/drilled too much into my bone. felt like I didn’t have a say as my parents decided it at the time and I went into a super dark depression afterward. chronic pain in both shoulders and neck. feel like I’m 70 sometimes always thinking about my body  

-been sexually assaulted like 5 times, was held down and choked while someone came inside me in the back of a minivan. another time was roofied and woke up naked in a bed of a guy I had no clue who he was and how I got there, couldn’t remember anything. passed out drunk in my bed another time after party I organized at home and woke up to a friend’s friend having anal sex with me. etc. Recent turn of events has me reliving the most recent one and it makes me feel so worthless and like it’s all my fault esp since it was so painful and has affected me the most. sometimes I feel like I hate my body

-on that note I seem to keep attracting guys who aren’t patient or sensitive enough to take things slow and I keep getting hurt by things moving too fast even when I keep saying that I need gentle progression/mega trust first but I feel like I’m just continuing to lose hope at genuinely connecting with anyone. I get attention from guys who tell me I’m cute/smart but I feel so detached from my body, like cardboard. feel hopeless and scared to trust men

-I know I’m not fat but feel like I am always criticizing my body, I look in the mirror and see huge hips and I tell myself I’m “too big” and take up too much space and my butt’s not big enough, etc. From being told I was too skinny as a little girl and then gaining weight after 1st surgery. Troubling? thing is now I weigh 139, I’m 5’10, which means I haven’t weighed this little since I was like 14. I’ve been told multiple times by guys I’ve dated that I’m hot and sometimes I look at myself and think, whoa I’m super skinny what am I talking about, And then it goes right back to critic eyes and it seems like everything I wear makes me look huge. also, as a performer in college, I got a lot of feedback to be skinnier and it feels like it’s permanently affected how I see myself. Like it’s a good thing if I go a day without eating even though I know that’s not healthy. does anyone relate??

-survived a mass shooting at work this year and now I feel like the ptsd is making me insane. It got better and then it got worse. I’m scared to go out grocery shopping for too long, I couldn’t even go out tonight because of all the fireworks sound like gunshots and I still feel like I’m in a state of shock 

-Student debt’s only close to like $40k but I got an arts degree and now just feel screwed after having taken time off for this 2nd shoulder operation and feeling so insecure/doubting myself &amp; my abilities to do anything “productive” // “of worth” with my life. 

-climate change extinction you know the drill

Everything just feels pointless and I have such a lack of motivation to do most things. Even the littlest things take so much energy. I feel like I can’t even talk to people for extended periods of time because I just want to lie down or be alone

"I hate this month : I hate January. With a passion. I've been in bed every available minute since Christmas, dreading it. It's stupid to dwell, and I know it, but I can't stop.

I lost my grandmother, who practically raised me and was my mother as a child, in January. She was the glue that held my family together. We lost her, and we fell apart. My mom and uncle both divorced their respective partners, there were unrepairable rifts caused, and members moved hours away. I haven't seen or spoken to my uncle in a decade. I barely see my cousins, who were basically my sisters growing up. I got so mad at my grandfather, the biggest father figure I had, over revelations made after her death that I didn't speak to him for years. We've since reconnected, but it's not like it was. My mom and I have grown a lot closer in the wake, but I've lost the nearness of everyone else. 

I nearly died in January. My ex-husband was abusive, and we fought... He strangled me with a power cord until I blacked out not even 5 feet away from our sleeping 6 month old. He was arrested. 

The court system basically told me that my life wasn't worth shit. He was out of jail in 4 days on ""time served."" He moved in with his 8 month pregnant girlfriend and turned off my electricity. He broke into my apartment on numerous occasions, despite my protective order. I tried to have something done about it, and his command threatened harm to me and to my career. I went to my own command and was beaten down verbally - they not only threatened my career, but did everything they could to me that couldn't be traced back to that incident. I had to look over my shoulder for months because there were people quite literally out to get me, waiting for the smallest slip up so they could Captain's Mast me. I ended up having a nervous breakdown in a doctor's office, and he quite possibly saved my life by helping me get discharged from the military. 

Two years ago today, a friend I grew up with, my best friend's little brother who became my other best friend and my very first love, killed himself. His wife alienated him from every one of his friends, got pissed and screamed at him and me when we tried to catch up via text a few years ago - years after they had gotten married and we had both moved on with life. So when he posted on Facebook basically begging for someone to talk to two years and two days ago, I ignored it. I didn't want to be responsible for bringing more shit to his life when she got pissed again. Apparently, they were having issues (again) and she had threatened to leave him and take his kids. She was packing bags. He took his life. 

It's hard to know how to feel. I've been struggling with it for years now. We hadn't seen each other in a decade. Hadn't spoken in years because the wife was very possessive and jealous. I kept my distance. But, he was a HUGE part of my childhood. We were dating off and on for probably the better part of 6 years. He was my first love, and I still cared about him and his family. They were my family too - I still talk to them. His sister is still a friend, though we grew apart thanks to geography and crappy husbands. I saw his mom a couple days ago, she hugged me, said she missed me, told me to come over soon. I live two blocks away, but I can't bring myself to go to that house. I feel like I have more sorrow and grief over him being gone than I'm entitled to. It makes it worse because I feel guilty for it. I don't know how much I'm allowed to feel, so I don't show much of anything and I've spent two years on the edge of boiling over from holding it in. I really fucking miss just knowing he was out there somewhere, with his goofy grin and his laughing eyes. He was always so happy, always laughing and smiling. I can't reconcile that with someone in a place so dark. And I guess that's part of my grief, too. Knowing that the world took that spark of life away from him and crushed him so thoroughly. It absolutely breaks my heart. 

But worst of all about January ... I was born and with every passing year, I'm reminded how little I've achieved with my life thus far. I'll be 33, I just finally got financially stable. And all I can think about is how miserable I am. 

I stayed up while the kids did for the new year hype, but I can't sleep now. My mom's dog is sleeping over here tonight. He's snuggly, where my dog isn't at all. So, he's asleep with his head on my stomach and I'm laying here with tears rolling down my face, trying not to disturb him. But I needed to get this out somewhere. It's probably an incoherent mess, but I feel a little lighter. 

But seriously... 
I really fucking hate January.",moderate

"2020 is the year I take a stand against depression. : Depression is a greedy soab. It takes far too much time, far too many lives. It ruins relationships with families, spouses, friends... It ruins the mind of those it afflicts. Treatment is a long process, with so many wrong roads to go down. 

I have tried pills; many kinds. I have tried therapy many times. The depression I have is something I can't fix with these things, I have learnt this. It took over 10 years to figure it out but better late than never. And while there may be no true end to it, I've found the best way to get over feeling depressed (in my case) is to actively rebel against it. 

""I don't want to cook dinner, I'll just have toast.""   
""I can't go for a walk, it's too cold.""   
""I don't feel like doing anything."" etc etc... You know the drill I'm sure.

But you know what, depression? Fuck you. I may not be motivated to do anything at all right now but out of sheer spite, as a complete middle finger to this horrible mental affliction... I'm going to prove you wrong. You do not own me.",moderate

Never been one to be invited to parties as much as I socialize and try to make more friends. but a friend invited me to one last minute tonight.

Grabbed him some waters and a few napkins and left. Spent 40 minutes driving around by my self listening to music.

The local late night pizza place gave me my order for free because they see me there all the time...

"So depressed that I've stopped sleeping... : I've been so depressed recently that I have stopped sleeping. It isn't intentional. My body just won't get tired until it's on the 36th hour. I have to stay up all night just to be able to sleep the next. It's not just my body. It's my mind as well. My mind just races, and even when it isn't racing, it's just this gentle but painful ""hum"" that is horribly consistent.

I slept last night...finally. I realized why my mind might be fighting it as well. When I wake up..? I am horrible. I'm waking up to a reality that I refuse to believe in. I wake up to find that all of my ambition (which I had to fight so hard the previous day to obtain) is now gone... I wake up ready to bite anybody's head off, and I have. I've had people text me to ask if I'm alright, and I've said ""Fuck you, fuck off,"" and then proceed to lie to them about whatever they ask before putting my phone down for the day and ignoring all the beeps. Now that I type that last word, I'm realizing that I should just put it on silent, or have it off altogether. I'll start by silencing it, though turning it off completely wouldn't be much of a loss to me. I use it to check the time (as my wristwatch is broken), but other than that, I don't need it.

"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

"What To Do After Depression : I‘m going to skip all of the details of my depression itself and address a different problem. 

I have had serious depression for a while- suicidal, now medicated, go to therapy, etc. I have found my own healthy coping mechanisms. I like to clean, do other chores and generally just keep myself busy with productive work.

But I keep running into an issue: Whenever I pull myself out of a depression episode, I just sit around and don’t do anything with my life. 

The real bitch about depression for me isn’t the suicidal thoughts, because I’ve learned to manage them. No, it’s the fucking lack of enjoyment of any activity. I just don’t get excited. It’s like a 24/7 flatline, and sometimes I want to be sad again just to feel something.

And I was after losing my last place at the Uni did I really evaluate my life, so I ditched that horrible toxic group in a real world that was making me feel absolutely shitty, the superficial conversations and completely bunked turning up to Jim’s Cafe. I didn’t feel like a huge loss at hurt me it felt like a relief and one less problem to deal with. I had a lovely couple of months being indoors which suited my own personality and what I wanted in life, got back into music, writing and soon began see a positives.

I then started making goals for myself, my first goals were to get up every morning so I did, I then I quit sugar and that made things easier and began exercising.  Then I started thinking what I wanted to do so, so I applied for my degree in social work and within weeks in, I was actually a student and doing something meaningful and productive again.

My ups didn’t last long as student fiancé had messed up my passport and literally a few days before the end of the term gather a years a terms, and this time I wasn’t that backing down leave part way through the year, self resilience and determination got me through that bump and thankfully the fees were sorted student finance admitted their mistakes I can finally see things getting slightly better

Then on the 16th December I got the call that my uncle lost his short battle with cancer and ended up having a very scaled down Christmas, didn’t feel like putting on Xmas films as I was upset and in shock, to this I’m still in this numb place and then add extra pressure I didn’t pass my first exam and that really pushed things right into the dark place.

"First day of a a new year full of old shit : Ever since I was about 14 I started to realize that what I was going through wasn't normal. I was (and still am) extremely depressed, but it came in waves. I am 17 now and have tried to kill myself 6 times and ended up in the hospital 4 times. My family has in no way supported me and constantly  tries to put me down. Everytime I try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention.

They make me move schools about every 5-6 months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. Currently they are home schooling me which means I sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about 10 hours. I cannot go outside and all social activities are banned I guess you would say. Everything in my house is under lockdown. For Christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. I have to ask for everything and most times the answer isn't just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture.

Going into this new year I cannot think of anything good that's going for me and I genuinely feel like trash. I got a really bad 'wave'  of pure helplessness and started to cut myself, I stopped myself before it got too bad but my arm is currently fucked up again.

"Realised how ugly I must be. : I'm a guy... but it still hurts a lot. This week spent with family during Christmas and New Years has completely hammered home the fact that I'm ugly. Or, the ugly one in the family. And extended family.

I know I've always looked terrible in photos, but just seeing me in a bunch of them alongside my siblings and cousins this week, and seeing people on Facebook commenting about and complimenting them but ignoring my presence... it hurts, even though they didn't even say anything. It's just that I definitely know I don't look good, and it feels like everyone else is smart enough to know it too, which makes me shrink into my chair even more.

On top of that, my sisters were getting attention from different people all week. Again, I know how ridiculous I must sound typing this as a *guy*. But I already feel invisible and worthless enough as is in my life... and this week couldn't have made me feel anymore unwanted and alone, from family, friends and strangers alike.",moderate
"Getting help or realizing your not able to do it yourself.. : Getting help for depression is good but why can't we just do it ourselves and no, I'm not one of those people who tell you to snap out of it I'm just saying when someone is depressed they might wonder to themselves why they can't just do it without help. Getting advice from a therapist is good, but having to ask for help because it's gotten too far might make others feel useless without other people and I'm really confused because I don't know what's best for anything anymore.

I try so hard to look at the positives. But I haven't had many lately. There's little I can enjoy anymore. There's nothing that can make it better. My heart feels like it's clouded with a dark ghost of the past. It drains my joy; it drains my spark. I can be surrounded by people and feel like the loneliest person.

Stupid for caring.

Stupid for believing.

Stupid for trying.

Stupid for not seeing that it was all a lie, and everything i thought i was feeling was as fake as your colored contacts and plastic nose.

Waiting for it to just end. : I was diagnosed 2 years ago with an illness that quite frankly isn't that bad in some but horrible in others and I got the shit end of that stick. I was trying to pull my life together everything was looking better I wasn't as depressed as I use to be and then everything went to shit. I honestly wanted to die the second I found out because I knew it was going to make getting my life together harder. But I didn't realise it was going to in a sense end it. But I kept trying because even as screwed as I thought I was I didn't really know how bad it was going to get and I saw my family really cared for me and I didn't want to hurt them so I fought.I went from being physically in the best shape of my life to being unable to walk to my bathroom on somedays without feeling drained. I'm in horrible pain everyday I went from never smoking anything to smoking weed almost daily as to bring down the pain a bit. My mind has been destroyed not by the weed but by the drugs that were used earlier in my illness when I was on them I went from being able to do calculus to having issues adding. My memory went to shit and even almost a year and a half later I'm not even half of what I use to be mentally.8 or 9 months ago I was told by my doctor that this disease is going to kill me and they no longer want to give me medication for it as it has done little to help me. I hope every single time I go to sleep I won't wake up. Everytime I allow myself to think I just imagine what I could have nothing amazing but something. I catch myself occasionally forgetting I can't do those things I want to do. Nights when I can't sleep from the pain I just wish for this to end. I've been to therapy got sent to psychiatric hospital after my 3rd surgery because I can't take this. The hospital made things much worse mentally. I've told people that my doctor says that I will die to this illness and surviving this long makes me feel like a liar. I don't know when this will kill me but my doctor said he'd be surprised if I had 5 years that is far to long. I'm not angry at the world I'm not upset I'm just done. I just want to sleep and never wake up I'm not alive I'm just existing at this point. I go through the motions of day to day life I don't seem depressed on the outside I make the same jokes about it like I use to as a way to show my friends I'm fine but honestly I'm not.,moderate

"Friends : I've only got a handful of friends, and recently two of my friends coincidentally got very wealthy at the same time. This molded their attitude towards life into a disgustingly materialistic one. They started judging everyone's worth by the weight of their pockets, and even though they were always cool with me, I decided I no longer wanted people of that sort in my life. 

Letting those guys go has been difficult, and in a rather contradictory manner - my heart tells me I was right but also wrong due to increased amount of solitude I now face. I never realized it would be this difficult living with yourself.

Not sure what to do anymore. I'm 32 and living alone and I have noone in my life I'm close to. Never had many friends and I find I rub people the wrong way especially if I try to befreind someone. The people I was friends with I've grown away from and I no longer feel enjoyment doing what I used to like.
Mostly spend my days laying on the couch sleeping or trying to occupy my mind with whatever I can find on reddit or youtube or whatever. It's just thinking about my failures in relationships and life in general leaves me with an ache that I can't stand. But just existed and waiting for life to pass isnt what I want, I don't know how to break the cycle. I committed myself last year after a rough period but regretted that decision, I've tried talking to therapists but nothing like that has helped. I had a fling that helped but it was back worse when it was over and I havent been able to climb back.

"How do you take care of someone with depression? : I have a friend that’s been diagnosed and she’s been really hard to deal with.  

She’s stubborn, sometimes she’s mean to me. I would worry about her all the time when she’s not with me and she’s having an episode because she would either run away from her house or cut. 

Sometimes when she’s not okay she’s mean to me. Not like “fuck you” mean but her way of just being sarcastic with all my genuine questions like “are you okay” or “im sorry If i said/did anythign wrong”. 

Often when she’s not okay when we’re face to face she doesn’t tell me what’s going on but I know something is wrong. Then she gets home and we’re texting. The second paragraph happens, then she starts saying how she doubts me and stuff like that. 

When she’s having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together. Sometimes when I take her back to her house, she would not go in, she would just sit in front of her house and I would have to literally beg her to go in. 

I have to deal with this every single day and everything I do is to make sure she’s okay and it’s REALLY taking a toll on my mental health. Its come to a point where I don’t even have a life anymore.

"January birthday blues : So my birthday is January 3rd. This is the first time my boyfriend and I will be celebrating my birthday together. I told him how I never organise anything for my birthday because my friends all let me down, and that it is actually a really depressing time for me. I have gained such a complex over the years with my birthday. My friends and family very rarely celebrate it with me, and when they do, its over during NYE celebrations, or ends up being an extremely mild affair. I see so many people throughout the year get completely spoiled on their birthdays. While I have got used to this disappointment, I was looking forward to this year, as my Boyfriend is a very thoughtful person, so I thought he would pull out all the stops. Turns out he didnt. His birthday was in November, and I took us on holiday for it. However, when I asked him yesterday if he planned anything, he hadn't. So I booked the restaurant. He has kids from a previous marriage, and I then realised that he has the kids that weekend. He said he would rearrange it, which he did, but I'm gutted, and heart broken tbh. I put so much thought into his birthday, yet he couldnt be bothered to organise anything for mine, or even confirming whether he had his kids that weekend or not. Its sorted, we're going to a nice restaurant sat night for my birthday, but I feel so let down that he was so thoughtless. Any suggestions on how I should move forward, in terms of how I should deal with this with my BF (btw, we have already had a huge argument about it, where he claimed i said i didnt want to do anything, which was not the case, but I'm struggling to move on). But more importantly, in terms of what I should do about taking ownership of this.

"I totally lost it at the very beggining of 2020 :  

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

In 2019 the company I work for has gone through a big transition from small company to bigger player in the field. A few of our senior workers didn’t like the change so I’ve stepped up (by my own choice, my bosses are actually fantastic and would never ask) and worked longer hours and weekends to keep everything going. I’m up for a huge promotion next year because of it.


Towards the end of the year I noticed I was getting more tired and snappy so I booked a long break over Christmas where we’d normally shut down, assuming it was exhaustion. Now I’m off I feel like it’s gotten worse. 


Spending time with people annoys me, I don’t find joy in anything I do. I literally sleep and watch videos all day. I haven’t left the house or showered for a week because I haven’t needed to. I assume that everyone hates me because I am so dull.


I thought the break would refresh me but I was just using work to cover up what I assume to be a deep depression. Looking back the reason I put so many hours in is because I didn’t want to have to deal with my life at all, I wanted excuses to not socialise.


I feel like a shell of a human, more robotic than anything else. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I don’t know what I’m going to do.

I kept getting questions as to why I am so numb to everything.  I lied saying I had flu the week before and not feeling 100%.
I needed suggestions whether or not I should confess to my family and friends? The reasons i didn't do it till now are :
1)Mental health awareness is very poor in my country. My family would likely think I am faking it or everybody feels low sometimes
2)Afraid of being judged by the very few friends I have left. I am also afraid they might leave me eventually 
3) I really don't want people to pity me

Any advice is appreciated.",moderate

"Give me a reason : 27 years old and honestly reading everyone's woes doent come near what happened, and currently still happening.

So let's kick this off right, LAS FUCKING VEGAS 
born and raised. Oh forgot to mention. I have biological brother and sister. Brother fucked off and did the typical male life and so did my sister.
Dont have really need to go down that unsupported family story. Just family members focuse on their own lonely lives.

Truth, I have been involved around death himself all my life 
3yo mother die
4yo father committed 
From 5-15 family pets
16 lost a friend  (he die as a hero)
17 on,  to many letters of funeral letters drove my grandmother in a self counting state.
I lost her back in September.

I can bring in the idols I looked up to and strove to be Strong for my family (while being the baby of the family) have the right things to say (even when theres nothing for me to say)

So ya truth, I myself is a ticking time bomb.

If anyone of my age or older should know what I'm going next.

I have a substant abuse issue, (weed and alcohol nothing harder) you may think ""that's fine, so do I""
And that's where you're wrong 

I can function while under the influence of in my system. (Just that sentence can get me fired any where)

So now, where do I place your minor love heart ache vs my life story of depression.

Well right here cuz, most of the time you'll hear ""oh you're spinning out of control.""  Or ""just fell like falling into a pit""

Hear is the truth, its stem from what you say vs what you truly want to say. 

And last night . . . Well the truth slipped and again I'm alone. 

I hopped on tell you my story but in reality I'm using this as a confessional, and honestly if you read done this far. I wish I can tell you life has some fun moments. 
But that reality is bought with someone going threw out their lives and going threw hell.

It's sad I cant even us my own money cuz I have to use it to eat. I may not look it but being a 6foot guy below 200lb I look like a thinner soldier but remove my clothes, you would think I'm anorexic or have a fast thyroid.
So just imagine an toothpick walking.

Walking feels like Im wearing weights on my legs

"Forever Lost : (22F) I’ve had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I’ve just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. 

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just need to let it out somewhere.

I’ve never posted before but this subreddit makes me feel some sort of comfort that I’m not alone in this. Thanks if you made it this far.

Love to all of you. ❤️",moderate
"I really. Really need help. I feel like my life is over. I have no one. I lost everything. : Hi there. This post will be fairly short because i prefer talking about my problems in dms. But uhh. Ill just say whats happening.

IVE been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half.

She saved me from an abusive relationship. And she Was the best thing in my life. But she was a very broken and unstable person.

She.. Lied. About being raped.  She made fake accounts to harass herself. She made fake accounts to accuse me and herself of cheating on eachother. She has anger issues. And an abusive family.

I helped her as much as i could. And she did too. I saved her from her abusive family and helped make her life better.

Weve been having relationship problems because after she confessed to her lies. She became increasingly abusive and harsh.  And.. A few days ago she cheated. On me.  It was on the same day that she insulted me and called me worthless and stuff

I dont know what to do.. I really dont. I fucking love her so much. I love her more than any thing and.. I forgave everything. My past girlfriend cheated on me 3 times and boasted about it and rubbed it in my face. I let my current know this. I let her know that any thing is okay. But cheating is the one thing i can not deal with. And now when it happened ive been so.. Broken.

I dont think she hates me. She has anger issues. She suffers from bullying. Abusive parenting. And lots of sexual assault.
Shes fucked up. Shes the most innocent. Pure person. But also the most sexual and slutty person. I dont know what to do.. Ive been crying so Much and i have no one to talk to. My best friend thats been the only person supporting kind of.. Got tired of me and told me to fuck off. I feel so suicidal and broken. I cant really talk to anyone in reallife due to my country.

I havent mentioned many things. So please dont make an opinion of me or her before asking me things. If youre willing to help me send me a message and  ill respond as fast as i can

Also somethjng important to mention is that we have really. Really good synergy. Physically we  are perfect for eachother. Sexually too. And our humor. Music taste. Beliefs. Religion. Everything is ideal.",moderate

"One night stand at new year's eve party : Okay, so this was my first party at the ripe old age of 15. I only knew two people at the party, one of which left cause they got bored and the other one knew most of them. 

I arrive, thank the host, bla bla. First hour or two im just chilling with the guy who was gonna leave. I get a beer, and drink most of it (my friend left after) and socially im doing better than i thought i would. Im having ""fun"". Few shots later still having fun. I had seemed to have hit it off with a girl who was single (spoiler shes the one night). Midnight comes and i drink like 3-4 glasses of champagne. I lie down --&gt; im drunk. 

After i get drunk i get loudish/talkative and just generally say whatever comes to my mind, including secrets/insecurities/depression. So my friend and the girl babysit me cause i cant walk in a straight line. And i start ranting on and on about my problems (mom's cancer, depression, choking myself, etc.). I think i cuddled the girl, but she stopped cause she wanted me to be sober while doing stuff. After that she took me on a walk so i could get fresh air. After which i started to hug her (vigorously) in front of my friend. 

Since this was also a sleepover me and her slept in the guest room. By this time i was kinda sober. I started to cuddle her which lead to making out and groping, but she stopped from going further cause again i was still kinda drunk and she just met me. The rest of the night we just cuddled. 

After we woke up she went to her friends. I was sober by this point which meant i went from confident social guy to depressed anti social guy. 
We talked a bit about why i was being antisocial, cuddled a bit more, i got her number and hugged for a really long time before i left.

After which i felt like shit not from the booze but just from the emptiness. I want to meet her again, but im scared that she'll get bored of the real me, the antisocial depressed me. She knew the drunk me, not the real one. Im also scared i'll hurt her physically or verbally, due to my depression and my previous relationship where i hurt the other person by ignoring her asking me out for over a year, even though she knew i knew. 


Tl;DR: Went to a party,  tipsy --&gt; fun, drunk --&gt; told all my secrets/insecurities to a girl. 

Made out/cuddled with her the whole night. 

Woke up --&gt; got depressed/antisocial/sober. 

Scared of contacting her cause of past trauma and insecurities.


Question: How do I go about contacting her, mind you I'm extremly awkward.

"Advice with post-hookup regret and low self esteem? : Great way to celebrate the new year and my birthday.

I am further repelled at mysel and disgusted with my body, every time I become conscious of my body I get flashbacks and am grossed out.

"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",moderate

"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate

"Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.",moderate

Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.,moderate
"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try...

How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,moderate

"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months.

"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",moderate

My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

Also, if I tell my school, they'd notify my parents and it would be an absolute shitstorm if they found out that I didn't tell them first. I'm so hopeless and I don't know what to do at this point. What should I do?",moderate
"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent.",moderate

"Another shitty new year. : I think it's fair to say that the past few years (since 2014 or so) each year got gradually worse and worse. Now here we are. 2020.

Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore.

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",moderate
"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

"I’m so empty : I wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. 


I’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. 

I don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore 

Depression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.

"Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.

I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.

But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. 

Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.

I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. 

I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. 

I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.

The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting.

I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations!

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",severe

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  

Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up.

Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",severe
"Help. : I'm 24 and I'm useless, I have studies in programming and sadly had been fairly smart through my life, but it does not even matter.

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

"I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me.

I’m literally on my last leg...I fucked up my relationship with the man and I love which ruined New Year’s Eve and, this past day I’ve been so depressed and sick to my stomach yet I just wanted to drink again WHY DO I ALWAYS NEED A DRUG TO SUPPRESS MY NATURAL STATE WHY AM I FUCKED UP LIKE THIS I STG I HAD SO MANY THOUGHTS OF JUST ENDING IT IDK WHY IVE BEEN CURSED WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN MY FMILY IS NORMAL. I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",severe

I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations!

Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",severe

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",severe

I’m literally on my last leg...I fucked up my relationship with the man and I love which ruined New Year’s Eve and, this past day I’ve been so depressed and sick to my stomach yet I just wanted to drink again WHY DO I ALWAYS NEED A DRUG TO SUPPRESS MY NATURAL STATE WHY AM I FUCKED UP LIKE THIS I STG I HAD SO MANY THOUGHTS OF JUST ENDING IT IDK WHY IVE BEEN CURSED WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN MY FMILY IS NORMAL. I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",severe

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with.

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery.

"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.
Also english isnt my first language so if have messed up the grammar or something somewhere you know why",severe

Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",severe

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",severe

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff.",severe

"I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it. Funny how the worst time of my life, now seems like it was the best.",severe

I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",severe

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with.

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery. I wish a drunk driver would have put me out of my suffering last night.",severe
"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling.

"Going in and out of happy and depressed. : I feel like this has always been a thing with me. A lot of days I'm just depressed the entire day, but most of them (especially recently) I seem to move in and out of short bursts of mania and depression. One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind.",severe

I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me.",severe
"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",severe
"Why am I fucking angry crying : I started dieting, I shaved off a few shitty traits, I tried and tried and succeeded and failed and accepted it all because I can't do anything about that past anyways. 

AND I FUCKING LIVED! i made it to 17. I made it to 2020. After all the plans and scares, well fuck I'm here.

So why the hell did I run to my bed and start crying. Not sobbing m, closer to the crying you get from hollowness. Like a regret that never got fixed. Tbh I might be having a stroke, I smell burning and there definitely isn't burning.

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop? All these stupid people I made in my head that haunt ever facet of life. Fuck you all, I'm tired. And I'm sorry but I'm bleeding. And tired. Time for sleep. Sleepity sleep.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

"I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it.

As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced.

"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety.

"I have to go back on a higher dose and I hate admitting it : A couple months ago, I talked with my doctor about going on a lower dose of my antidepressant because it was affecting my memory and sleep (so we thought)

My wife and I made jokes that I was on such a high dosage, I was basically on horse tranquilizers.  

Two months ago, I went on a lower dose and everything was fine.  I just took less and didn't feel worse or better.  Maybe a little less sluggish and my memory was a bit better (I had troubles remembering some stuff).  

The last two months have been great except for the last couple weeks.  

It started with more worry.  I started thinking and stressing about is everything okay?  Is my relationship in a good place?  Is my wife happy?  Am I doing everything I can at work?  Why can't I do better in general?

I shrugged it off just being regular stresses and took this holiday season to just relax and enjoy.  It was going fine, but still I had nagging stresses and felt myself going into a bigger and bigger hole every time something not ideal happened.  I would be down for hours afterwards and I wasn't about to admit to myself or my wife that I wasn't doing well.   

I pushed so hard to be okay that a couple days ago, something very trivial happened where I took it to heart and a few days later, it was all I could think about when I was about to go to sleep, going to the movies, with friends or family.  

I've come to the conclusion that I need to go back up a little on my dosage like I was before.  My depression is back.  My doctor said if I started feeling it, I should go back up to the old dosage. (1/2 a pill instead of a 1/3)  

I feel like a failure.  My depression is still there and I can't beat it without medication.

My sleep is still the same on both dosages.  My memory will get worse possibly.  Maybe my methods I've built in remembering will help and I can not fall back into forgetting things.

But I'd rather be forgetful than frustrated, sad, angry, and overall unpleasant to be with the past couple weeks.  

I'm not suicidal at all, I'm not wanting to harm myself, I'm just sad and it's affecting my overall happiness in life and it's causing strain on my relationships.


I'm waiting for my wife to come home to talk to her about it and I know she's going to be supportive, but I'm in such a hole that I feel like she won't be.  I'm so in my head.  

Can I get some support?  

P.S.  If I do show my wife this, and now she's reading this, I'm sorry for the past couple weeks of shit.  I love you and my depression is no indicator how happy and in love I am with you.  You are my best friend and you didn't do anything wrong.  I know this is hard for you to fully understand, so, thank you for your love and support always :)",severe
"Any advice? : So... I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  
I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  
don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:

I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself.

 I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  
I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.

Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  
My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  
He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.

And then there's me.  
I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  
I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  
Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.

Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  
I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.

"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.


Thank you so much!",severe
"I’m so empty : I wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. 


I’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. 

I don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore 

Depression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.


Not quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don’t want to live like this anymore. Any advice is appreciated",severe
"I can't kill myself because of my parents : I just hate it. My parents are often annoying and rude with me, but when they see news on the tv where young people died they often say that they wouldn't bear if I died and that they would kill themself.

And because of this I can't kill myself. I would feel too guilty. I've now been in a depression for a long time and it's getting worst and worst really fast. It's actually come to a point where I'm hoping that my parents will die/kill themself/tell me that they don't care about me, or anything that could let me kill myself in peace. I'm spoiling on the inside because my will of dying is growing fast, and I feel like I can't do anything.

"Being single makes everything worse... : My whole life i’ve been alone. I’ve been with handful of women here and there but never anything even remotely  serious. As I grow older (I’m 24) all my friends are settled down with someone. Married, kids, engaged, long relationships.

I’ve always been single. And the sad part is, I don’t know what i do wrong. I’m a good man, passionate about my goals, caring for others, funny, good looking, and social. But i’ve suffered greatly from OCD and depression and even with my wall up, people seem to look at me as insecure or weak (my only justification). It’s almost as if all the good qualities of mine go away. The cycle goes that women are attracted to me when they meet me, but as the weeks go on they get unattracted and put me as their friend.

Over 24 years you have enough of feeling like you’re not good enough. Tired of seeing your friends scoring dates and one night stands. Tired of the random dude at the bar picking up the woman you like. I decided to not even try anymore but it still hurts that EVERYone i know looks at me as the “always single and alone” guy. People even bring it up to me. It really hurts me deep down",severe
"Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.

I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.

But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. 

Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.

I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. 

I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. 

I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.

The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. 

I think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though.",severe
"Best antidepressant for major depressive disorder? : I’m currently on Adderall 30 mg twice a day and have been since 2014.

You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality.

I don’t respond to CBT. I’ve tried it multiple times over the years and my therapist said it’s time to stop. I’m too mentally and physically ill for regular treatments and have to experiment.

First day in 2020 and all.i want is to kill myself. : [removed],severe
"I feel tired of living, can't help but feel like I should be done with life by now and that I'm just dragging it. : [removed]",severe
"I feel like killing myself would be the only to make my existence meaningful : 1) I feel like an asshole for admitting this, but I know my family and friends would suffer and I want them to. I feel like it's the only way to make anyone FEEL anything, that I'll be permanently in their memories if I do that, and that I'm just an afterthought if I continue living.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff.",severe

"I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it.

It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness?

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing.

"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety.

"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.

Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  

Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up. 

Happy f&amp;\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.

"I'm really struggling : So I don't know how to start things like this, So I'll start with basics. I'm 16yo, diagnosed depression at 14yo. Since then, my life is total mess. I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",severe
"Help. : I'm 24 and I'm useless, I have studies in programming and sadly had been fairly smart through my life, but it does not even matter. It's only make my family expect me to be great which I never had any idea how to be. Right now I feel I'm unbelievably stupid. I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",severe

"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what.

"Going in and out of happy and depressed. : I feel like this has always been a thing with me. A lot of days I'm just depressed the entire day, but most of them (especially recently) I seem to move in and out of short bursts of mania and depression. One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind.",severe

"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.

"Best antidepressant for major depressive disorder? : I’m currently on Adderall 30 mg twice a day and have been since 2014. I was on 20 mg total Prozac for my depression (started in late 2013) when I first started Adderall in 2014, but in January 2015 I decided Adderall would be enough to handle my depression and my ADHD, so I stopped taking Prozac. But now, years later, my depression has gotten worse and I really feel I need an antidepressant again to use in conjunction with my Adderall. I have tried Wellbutrin, but its too much with the Adderall.",severe

I was so close to ending my suffering, my constant piercing pain. instead here i am full of hatred towards my body and being, aching with anxiety and fear of faillure and addicted to all sorts of substances. i have a dream and my very dream is nine months away, i’ve wanted to go to medschool ever since i can remember and i’m one interview away from accomplishing all i’ve ever wanted yet i can’t be bothered waiting another 3/4 of year nor do i know for sure that my childhood fantasy isn’t but an illusion that will never fullfill my inner emptiness. 

overall i just want to die, never waking up again seems so simple and desirable. Life is too complicated and i don’t wanna be part of it anymore. i hope i won’t fail my next attempt at ending my existence.",severe

I wanna give up and die. : Things are not going good for me at all. I failed my 9th grade English class last year because I could not make grades. Not because I am stupid or anything it was a lot on me since I was in honors. I kept it too myself and moved on with a new mindset and trying to pass my 9th grade class and my 10th. I missed 28 days of school because some days I don’t feel like getting up in the morning my grades are bad school is not my thing I hate doing things that are not going to help me in my future. You may call me lazy but I physically can’t get up I don’t know what I wanna be in life my grandma passed god has not helped me not once I don’t know. So I have been told I am going to fail 10th grade and I honestly wanna kill myself. This might not get a lot of attention but I wanna say I loved this world and honestly had some genuinely fun times. But I can’t move on.,severe
"I could just end it.... : I could just kill myself and no one would know or care. I'm a burden to my friends and my family and now the only person I ever trusted to talk to about how I'm doing wants nothing to do with me anymore. I'm completely alone, worthless, and hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to make it through this year and no I won't see a therapist, I don't trust therapy and I never have, it's a waste of money. Mental health is not worth that much to me. Deep down I wish someone would commit an act of violence wherever I am at a given time and would kill me so I could spare my family knowing I'd killed myself. It's over, I have nothing.

"I want people to hurt me even more : This is all I think about. I wish I could get more hurt. I don't deserve any better.

I want to break every mirror in my home and never look at myself again. I might as well just dissociate and start imagining that I'm already dead.",severe
"please tell me i'm not the only one who has trouble accepting they're getting better : i have been through a lot these last few years, but i started to get better recently thank to my meds, therapy and some changes in my life (stop seeing my toxic father, for example). however, some part of me doesn't want to feel better. instead, i feel like my mental illnesses are a part of my personality and i don't want to get through it all, i don't want to lose those parts of me because i don't know who i would end up being without them. i'm afraid of quitting therapy, of stopping taking my meds. i feel that without those things i would get worse again. it's like a dependency i've been developing through time. and i just don't want to lose it all. i don't know if i'm explaining this exactly how i feel, but i hope someone understands.",severe
"How do I tell my therapist that I should be hospitalized? : My therapist has been asking me if I  would like to be hospitalized. At the time I refused.

I am very worried about costs....how can I bring this up to them and talk about it?",severe
"How do I keep going? : Im diagnosed depression and i dont know how many more days I can handle the pain.

I’ve attempted once in November but my friend saved me. I am trying me best seeing a psychiatrist, going through multiple antidepressants, have a good set of friends I can count on (I feel lucky as many dont have this) and parents who love me and actually go to a pretty good school. There is no one event that pinpoints my depression I guess I was just born broken. I feel depressed 24/7 and have “attacks” atleast once a day where its really intense to the point i can feel my heart in pain. Im just tired of living like this. I am trying everything i can but i dont see any light ahead of me. At this point its not if i will commit suicide but rather when. I think ill do it when i go back to uni after the holidays.",severe

You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse.

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me.",severe
"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",severe
"Why am I fucking angry crying : I started dieting, I shaved off a few shitty traits, I tried and tried and succeeded and failed and accepted it all because I can't do anything about that past anyways. 

AND I FUCKING LIVED! i made it to 17. I made it to 2020. After all the plans and scares, well fuck I'm here.

So why the hell did I run to my bed and start crying. Not sobbing m, closer to the crying you get from hollowness. Like a regret that never got fixed. Tbh I might be having a stroke, I smell burning and there definitely isn't burning.

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop? All these stupid people I made in my head that haunt ever facet of life. Fuck you all, I'm tired. And I'm sorry but I'm bleeding. And tired. Time for sleep. Sleepity sleep. Fucking nightmares again right? Just live every fucking nught fot the last forever. Fuck you, at meast kill me this time.",severe
"I think i’m going to kill myself : everything is getting bad again, my trauma and body issues are resurfacing, my relationship is failing and it’s all my fault, i’ve lost my will to live, school is fucking awful (i’m getting bullied and the school couldn’t give less of a fuck), i’m so fucking stupid and depression is making it worse and i just don’t want to be alive anymore.

But i can’t kill myself yet, i don’t want anyone to miss me",severe
"Im a time bomb : Im the stereotype for you know what. And to be honest it's not far off. I have a deep hatred for people, they made me this way. Meds ruined my fucking life... Pills are not a fucking cure-all, They dont know how to handle someone with mental Illnesses so they dope them up until they feel the poor bastard is under control. Therapists and psychiatrists are full of shit just some quacks. Im just gonna say it...Abilify ruined my fucking life it's probably the cause for everything.",severe

"Parents, Indian parents... Help [20M] : So, my mom considers me a psycho and gives me the typical ""don't be sad, it's all in your mind"" talks every goddamn day. How do I educate her on how bad depression can be? I'm on meds and my therapist doesn't want to talk with my parents, yet, but it's killing me. It's been an year since I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder.",severe
"I have way too many mental (and other) problems to fix and depression is the “lightest” one. : Tbh, I wish I only had depression instead of all of those mental problems like: OCD, ADD, BDD, social anxiety, addictions, apophenia, maladaptive daydreaming AND depression on top...
Everyday I wakeup and try to push my time away so I can eat (because thats all I enjoy) I dont enjoy any other activity I do. I try to workout, I do it regulary and I meditate everyday and I do keto which helps, but its so hard when you are addicted and food is only thing on my mind... Im also paranoid 100% of the time, scared to meet certain people because I see them as a sign that I am ugly (yeah... apophenia, ocd and bdd causes me to think in that way, I cant explain, it sounds weird when you try to explain it). I do rituals to keep myself safe, im scared of a lot of things: people, height, sounds. I just feel so broken with all of those problems. Im lonely too, i only have my mom to talk to. I cant make connections with other people. Anyways, no wonder why im suicidal..,",severe
"I don’t want to live my life sick and tired : I have a chronic pain/fatigue condition that will be lifelong. Treatments aren’t helping (not unusual for the condition) and everyday is hell. 

It’s looking like I’ll have to leave school
because my cognitive function is too heavily affected and I’m too sleepy to make it to and thru classes. I can’t work enough to pay my expenses and I headed towards disability...which I don’t really see any point in living then. 

I don’t respond to CBT. I’ve tried it multiple times over the years and my therapist said it’s time to stop. I’m too mentally and physically ill for regular treatments and have to experiment.

I want so bad to die young. I don’t want to be awake anymore. I feel so sick right now.",severe
This world is making me go insane : Its the first day of 2020 and i hope that everyone else sees the world in my perspective but i just cant take it anymore i know someone will disagree with me and proably downvote this post for having a different opinion but I’m just gonna say it when these HK protest started i didn’t care but when i heard of people getting hurt on both sides i started to act a little skeptical and concerned one day i posted a video of a chinese man getting set on fire on r/morbidlyreality and all i got was “this is fake” and “your just the ten cent army” and when i saw a picture of a protestor who got hit in the face with a gas canister everyone was supporting him and saying whoever did this were monsters and I’m like ok then so i can sucker punch an old man for having a different opinion but if he has your opinion then I’m the monster this revelation just changed everything its all “FREE HK” i see everywhere but never stopping and thinking “maybe my side has done bad things too” but when i say this I’m suddenly the dumbass who hates democracy all of you are just saying this because it looks cool and never think fuck all of you its making me insane i don’t know what to do all i hear is HK HK HK i just want it to stop i want people to just be kind to each other i don’t know  what to do anymore,severe

"I feel like killing myself would be the only to make my existence meaningful : 1) I feel like an asshole for admitting this, but I know my family and friends would suffer and I want them to. I feel like it's the only way to make anyone FEEL anything, that I'll be permanently in their memories if I do that, and that I'm just an afterthought if I continue living.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff.",severe

"I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it. Funny how the worst time of my life, now seems like it was the best.",severe

I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",severe

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with.

"I have nothing to look forward to for the new decade. : There is one thing though and that is for today (new years day) to be over. The holidays make me so miserable and so does winter. I know winter wont end soon but I'm so glad the holidays will. It's not just me. I see so many people actually miserable. Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery. I wish a drunk driver would have put me out of my suffering last night.",severe
"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling.

I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety.

"Any advice? : So... I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  
I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  
don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:

I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself.

 I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  
I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.

Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  
My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  
He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.

And then there's me.  
I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  
I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  
Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.

Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  
I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.

"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.

"I’m so empty : I wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. 


I’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. 

I don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore 

Depression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.


Not quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don’t want to live like this anymore. Any advice is appreciated",severe
"I can't kill myself because of my parents : I just hate it. My parents are often annoying and rude with me, but when they see news on the tv where young people died they often say that they wouldn't bear if I died and that they would kill themself.

And because of this I can't kill myself. I would feel too guilty. I've now been in a depression for a long time and it's getting worst and worst really fast. It's actually come to a point where I'm hoping that my parents will die/kill themself/tell me that they don't care about me, or anything that could let me kill myself in peace. I'm spoiling on the inside because my will of dying is growing fast, and I feel like I can't do anything.

"Being single makes everything worse... : My whole life i’ve been alone. I’ve been with handful of women here and there but never anything even remotely  serious. As I grow older (I’m 24) all my friends are settled down with someone. Married, kids, engaged, long relationships.

I’ve always been single. And the sad part is, I don’t know what i do wrong. I’m a good man, passionate about my goals, caring for others, funny, good looking, and social. But i’ve suffered greatly from OCD and depression and even with my wall up, people seem to look at me as insecure or weak (my only justification). It’s almost as if all the good qualities of mine go away. The cycle goes that women are attracted to me when they meet me, but as the weeks go on they get unattracted and put me as their friend.

Over 24 years you have enough of feeling like you’re not good enough. Tired of seeing your friends scoring dates and one night stands. Tired of the random dude at the bar picking up the woman you like. I decided to not even try anymore but it still hurts that EVERYone i know looks at me as the “always single and alone” guy. People even bring it up to me. It really hurts me deep down",severe
"Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.

I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.

But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. 

Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.

I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. 

I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. 

I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.

The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. 

I think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though.",severe

I wanna give up and die. : Things are not going good for me at all. I failed my 9th grade English class last year because I could not make grades.

"Feeling like I don't have reasons to be depressed : I was overthinking a little. I've been diagnosed with bipolar depression a couple of years ago, but I remember having it (or at least being a big melancholic) my whole life, and I somehow don't feel like I have ""enough reasons"" to be depressed.

I see so many people having their depression triggered or caused by major tragic events in their lifes like truly having a difficult and shitty life with family, school and even addictions issues; but in my case (or at least most of it) I get very depressed due to romantic issues. I think that the most recurrent event in my life is loving some girl and not being corresponded and, in most cases, having to see her with someone else. In front of all of this I feel so diminished, like it isn't a valid reason to be like this. I get so bad, like really suicidal, sometimes and I feel dumb by thinking that if someone asked me ""But you wanna kill yourself because of that girl?"" I'd promptly would say yes.

Of course, it isn't solely this that makes me miserable. There are truly other aspects of my life that sadden me a lot, but specially the romantic one have such a huge toll on me. I feel so unwanted and unimportant, ignored and even blame myself a lot for thinking it's my fault the other person don't feel the same, and for putting myself into some situations I see myself as a fool.

For me is so hard being alone. Unfortunately, many of the friendships I have with girls exist because in some point I was interested in some way, and I feel bad that nothing came out of it. I don't like to get too intimal with people I don't know, and it's really hard to get romantically involved with friends because they're insecure it will ruin the friendship or even because of being seen as a brother or only as a friend. I know I'm wrong acting like this. I'd be a little more comfortable and feel less unwanted if only some kind of caress happened, a kiss, of even sex in some cases. But, well, with so many people having ""worst"" issues, I feel like this is nothing and that I'm dumb for letting this kind of thing take me down.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?

It's my first time posting here, and idk, was just feeling like letting it out.  
(Btw, not native english speaker. Might have some mistakes)",severe
"How do I tell my therapist that I should be hospitalized? : My therapist has been asking me if I  would like to be hospitalized. At the time I refused. However as my treatment has been progressing, I feel as if I have not made any progress. I wish to tell her I have changed my mind. I am very worried about costs....how can I bring this up to them and talk about it?",severe
"I never feel like I'm doing enough and I'm worried I'm going to be a failure. : I'm a 20 year old guy working about 25-35 hours a week for minimum wage in food services. I'm going to school full time and have a pretty solid gpa. My plan is to become a highschool teacher and I'm making decent progress towards it. This is about the only thing that I can tell myself for reassurance when I really start to feel down though. Still, it will take me 4 years (1 1/2 more) of community college to get the associates and the 90 units I need for subbing and an additional 3 years to become a teacher, and I feel like that makes me seem weak. Especially since you're supposed to get that associates degree in 2 years. 

Now to explain the insecurities I have, I guess ill start with my weight. I think being a fat kid really messes with your development. Not just because kids constantly tease you but it literally caused my hormones to go out of whack and give me high estrogen in highschool. I lost 100 pounds before my senior year and I'm still chubby 3 years down the road. 
I just cant stick to a exercise and diet regimen for very long. I'm about 30 pounds overweight with probably 20 of those pounds being fat. I do go running up hills and/or do bodyweight circuits and burn around 600 additional calories a day. Still I offset this by eating 2800 calories or more every day. With all that's going on in my life I wish I could just accept my current weight and say I'm healthy, but I'm not that attractive because of it. I have a lot of weight on my stomach and I have a bit of female breast tissue that makes me look feminine with my shirt off. My body makes me cringe when I look at it and I constantly am thinking about how gross I probably look. With all the other shit going on in my life I just cant set aside more than the 2 hours a day I already put into my body and the food addiction has actually improved from when I was a kid and would eat 4000 calories a day. I'm hungry 24/7 and it hurts when people tell me I just need to stop being lazy and get into shape upon bringing this up. 

As far as my face goes, I'm like an average 7/10 or so. I can't really complain about it even though I could look a lot nicer. I am told I look like a 16 year old a lot.

Another huge insecurity of mine is having a small penis. It's right under 5 inches with girth on the low end of average and I worry it will severely limit the girls that will be willing to have a relationship with me. I know everyone is different, I just hope that the girls I'm attracted to dont end up being the type to care so much. 

The combination of extra weight, female breast tissue, a bit of a baby face, and being 6'0 tall make me feel like an awkward teenager still and my body just wont grow out of it. 

As far as hobbies go I play guitar regularly and I do slowly achieve goals I set for it. Still, I dont have the time to put into it to become a professional level musician even though my theory knowledge is close to it. I used to be really good at piano but I stopped playing when my mom died. Music in general is the only reason I'm still alive as corny as that sounds. It's my favorite part of the human experience and one of the closest things we have to magic. Although guitar can do a good job distracting me, I dont feel fulfilled when practicing in my room. 

In highschool I was a heavy drug user for about 10 months of my life. I can't say for sure, but I theorize that I did a lot of damage to my mental development by taking xanax, opiates, and muscle relaxers damn near every day and often at the same time, washing them down with alcohol or codeine cough syrup. I was so depressed back then and my parents being old fashioned, didn't believe in depression. I self medicated and self-destructed for a while until something interesting happened. I asked the girl of my dreams out and she rejected me. My initial urge was to commit suicide but somehow rationality stepped in and I just threw away the drugs and set out to improve myself. I lost 70 pounds in 4 months and came back to my senior year completely different and clean except for marijuana. I think I wanted to prove her wrong about me because in my mind I was pretty sure she just thought i was a loser. 

Eventually i ended up experimenting with psychedelics which sadly gave me PTSD for about a year. I was believing in spiritual forces and extra sensory perceptive abilities because I was having flashbacks from the massive doses of LSD I had done. It took me a long time to figure out that it was my amygdala giving me flashbacks and that i wasnt seeing into some higher dimension and it really fucked me up to be borderline psychotic for all that time. 

At this point I've never been even slightly romantically involved with a girl even though many have been interested in me. I have strong requirements that any girl I date be a potential candidate for marriage even if she isnt necessarily the girl I end up marrying. Why would I date someone who I know my relationship wont work out with? One girl initially seemed great, but as we talked more, I realized her values were different from mine and that's the closest I've been to being in a relationship. Most girls, it only takes a few weeks of knowing them to rule them out. I find my situation to be additionally complicated by the fact that I like conservative minded women, but I'm not christian and not exactly conservative. I have bounced back and forth on the political spectrum until deciding the best result would be of compromise and unity, meeting in the middle. A decrease of radical ideas rather than a swing in either direction seems to be a philosophy that can be applied at multiple levels of life. 
A lot of college girls are crazy liberal and having tons of sex with different guys, not planning for the future, going to festivals etc... I wouldn't set myself up for failure with these types who are the opposite of the christian girls. 

I want to meet someone who is a good compliment to me, that would build me up and be a positive force in my life , but who also isnt trapped by dogma and institutional fears. I think I'm a very exceptional person. Which doesn't mean I'm great but that I fall under many exceptions both very good and very bad. This seems to make it harder to find people who i really connect with on a deep level even though superficially connecting with people is something I'm quite adept at, especially for an introvert. 

I write all of this out of loneliness and fear. I want to have someone to show affection to and to recieve affection from, and I'm worried that my inadequacies and my past and my odd perspective will ultimately lead me to becoming a failure who no one good wants to be around.

 I know I might be building a slippery slope here but this feeling gnaws at me constantly. Along with occasional paranoia and panic, and sometimes I just go completely numb. You see, I have really bad depression but I try not to let it define me and I dont like thinking that every word that comes out of my mouth is the result of a mental illness. So I've laid on the table so much of what bothers me on a daily basis and then decided to reveal that yes, I am depressed and I am also a human being who wants to feel like they are more than a diagnosis.",severe
"How do I keep going? : Im diagnosed depression and i dont know how many more days I can handle the pain.

"Question about coming off meds (cymbalta) : Hey just wanted to know if someone in the same boat could offer some advice. 
Long story short I’m depressed and a little bit anxious and have been on cymbalta the last 3 or 4 years. On 90mg a day for a while then I did a lot of work on myself last year and lost some weight and dropped to 60 and then in November to 30mg (all this was discussed with my psychiatrist btw).
So I saw him maybe 3 weeks ago and we decided to try coming off entirely. So for the first week I was taking one every other day but now haven’t had one for maybe 5 days.

And so that’s the backstory, but my questions are about side effects from coming off them. I just feel really down and emotional at the moment. And I’m really hoping it’s just a temporary thing as I get used to not having meds, and that this isn’t just what I am like off the meds entirely :/ 
Specifically I just feel really sad and down and lack of energy but not like sleepy. It’s more of a sadness then just depressed. And a little bit of anxiety. I suppose it doesn’t help that cause of the holidays I’ve been drinking a bit and eating really unhealthily. 
But anyway I gues the main question is - is it normal to feel this way when coming off antidepressants and is it just temporary? Has anyone else come off cymbalta - what was it like for you?",severe
"Reaching my breaking point. Again. : I have bipolar disorder type two and CPTSD from childhood trauma, and from being in a severely abusive relationship. I was raped in 2018 and re-traumatised. I was on sickleave for a year. 

I'm a computer scientist and landed my first job in 2017, at the age of 31 (finished my degree when I was 29). For years I was depressed because I didn't have any money and couldn't support myself financially. I was at my breaking point. Until I magically actually got a job.

I enjoyed my job. A lot. It gave me purpose and a sense of accomplishment. 

Then 2018 happened and I couldn't even go outside without having a panic attack and I ended up on sickleave while I was in therapy. Which lasted a year.  
During this time, the thought of being a burden on my colleagues was contributing to my depression. I was happy to get back to work, but I was also a bit worried. But it worked out well for 5 months,  even though a particular coworker was being toxic and I had fallen behind and couldn't quite catch up. But I kept trying.

Then last month, my grandmother died. And I don't know why but it triggered my depression. I have to commute by train to work and every day I had to resist the urge to jump on the tracks. I went to work 2 hours early just so I could cry by my desk. I wanted to jab a pen into my arm to injure myself. I had a complete meltdown when a coworker casually asked me ""How's it going?"". So I ended up on sickleave again throughout december while I sorted out meds with my doctor. 

I started feeling better and I was excited to get back to work and maybe regain a sense of purpose.

I was supposed to work on the 30th of december, but I logged into our portal and saw that no one was working. And there weren't any tasks I could do, so there wasn't any point of me going to work (we can do this. Saving up overtime hours and then use those hours to take time off). I didn't notify my boss like I'm supposed to do because he was on vacation.   
I had turned off text message notifications because of my depression so I didn't see that he had texted me. He called me around noon on the 31th to... basically yell at me. 

He said things like ""You can't keep doing this"" (it's the first time it's happened), and ""any more sickleave incoming?"" (how am I supposed to know?) and ""You HAVE to go to work on thursday"" (well duh? I don't have vacation?). But because of trauma I went into trauma-mode and couldn't stand up for myself or explain. I made an honest mistake that I could have explained, and I could have stood up for myself and answer him in the way I wrote in the paranthesis, but I turned into a child that was being scolded.

Yesterday I started researching the equipment I need to kill myself. I started drafting suicide notes in my head. 

I'm going to the doctor today (I bet the boss is going to yell at me for that too) and it's currently 7 am and I'm crying and want to die. I have no idea if I'm able to work. I have no idea if I can deal with the sight of train tracks again. I think I'm going to have to go on sickleave again. But then my boss will hate me even more. Going to explain the situation to my doctor and see if he has any advice. I'm currently not in therapy but I'm going ask my doctor to hook me up with a therapist.

Life has no meaning or purpose.

"Happy fucking new year : I've been struggling with a major depressive episode since about 2014. Not my first, but maybe the worst since my first in 1989 when I made my first (pathetically failed) suicide attempt. For most of the next 4 years I hid it - apparently successfully - until a dissociation crisis in Dec 2018 scared me enough to take another chance on the local mental health system despite the significant risk their antiquated attitudes to mental illness would cost me my job and maybe my family.

A few months later, I finally told my wife, who is local, and was treated to a lecture about how I'm weak, how everyone has problems, how I was stupid to let the doctors ""trick"" me into taking pills when all I needed was good friends and a hobby. I brushed it off, and worked it anyway. This time last year I was in full remission and came off the meds. And I was doimg great, feeling more like *me* than I had in decades. 

But the weeks became months, and the months added up, and by the time summer came I was painfully aware of how disconnected we were. Some of that is definitely due to my depression - the sour moods, the pulling away - but more was because she had just refocused in ways that excluded me from her life. And when I look back, I realised that half my problem had been that when things were worst I no longer felt safe reaching out to her. In August I started slipping again, in October I needed to gp back on meds, by the end of November my doctprs gave me anti-psychotics - just in case the urge to self-harm or suicide got too much to manage.

An now it's a New Year. I had a long break over Christmas so I wanted to visit family and friends back home. She and the kids didn't come. And it's been so good. The enthusiasm and love from friends and family is incredible. I haven't felt so loved and wanted in so long. That's a problem. 

Today I realised that depression has killed my marriage. I don't know how we can get back from here, but I know the sense of isolation and the lack of partnership is a big part of why I relapsed. Getting bavk might literally be impossible. And now I'm stuck with an impossible decision on top of already having days when I really, really wish it would all just end.",severe

I don't feel happy about life anymore. I can't see my future and frankly, I don't want to. I feel stupid, mentally degraded, emotionally stunted. I've been on meds for three years, and while there's been a difference, I don't think I've been able to address the core issues.

I haven’t been able to truly live my young years and it makes me sad because I know I’ll regret it in the future. Also I got into abusive relationships back to back so I wasted 3 years on those. I’m just heartbroken, depressed and would rather be alone or at work rather than living my life. Anyone feel the same or any mature adults who had a past like this?",severe
"I was messed up bad over what I lost in 2015 (for four + years), and now 2019 is a new nightmare... : I got diagnosed with P.T.S.D. this last year, and though I already knew what I was experiencing, I think that it all unknowingly to me became a lot, lot worse this past year...

My P.T.S.D is slightly centered around bad incidents, yes, but they are from so far back in this life now and I am thick skinned and tough, and I can take it, but where this ""P.T.S.D."" is really getting to me hard is in moments of happiness not cherished, not even realized. Precious moments lost and opportunities discarded are eating away at my soul like you would not believe. Music, imagery, sounds, smells, so many visuals, feels, everything is taking me back to this past year...

I... I'm going to start fuckin' crying like a baby because this is the first time I've actually come out and said this blatantly without being vague on here with my posts...

You know that feel after a breakup when you know that you're unstable and you cling on and hang on to an image, an attachment of someone? And yet...deep down, you know but don't want to admit to yourself just yet that you do know that they aren't the one? You know how your mind is secretly racing over the ""grass is greener"" thoughts of a new love that will come along? Maybe you're right back on Craigslist or here, or wherever, to just find that immediate relief, someone to talk to...and it all hurts... The time getting through a loss like that hurts, but you do it..?

...When they say ""You'll know,"" they really mean it...

I knew in 2015 that, while I started dating a girl I truly loved and thought was great, I left behind my Soulmate... ...It was a girl whom I met right at the very moment I stopped believing in such things. I ran from her because I thought I saw red flags--my own red flags--where I was about to fall back into an instability of mine to believe in such things...

She just stood out...

...

Long story short: I left her behind... I broke her heard. I thought about her for the next four years and killed my relationship/friendship with the other girl I loved... We broke up just over a year ago, and I waited to let myself calm slightly before going back to find that girl I left behind...

I was numb from a lot of past trauma to have cut my emotions off to begin with regarding love and especially true-love, but in the last four years, I experienced even more trauma...a lot of it... I won't list it here, but it was trauma of many different types.

I started dating my Soulmate at the beginning of 2019, and I took her for granted...

I was so lost that I didn't recognize anything in my life as being ephemeral or breakable or anything... I just.. I was dead inside. I couldn't lift a finger to do anything... I thought I was stable, and that's why I came back into her life, and as soon as I saw her face, just as in 2015, I fell apart... When she is around, the air is electric. It's on fire. I can't explain it. All I know is that she is the catalyst... ..She told me she loved me far before I did in 2015. She used the term Soulmate first. I was terrified. I knew how I reacted to losing loves far less than her...and I didn't want to imagine the possibility of losing her...

I lost her...

Not forever, I dearly hope. This isn't the normal ""break"" relationships take when they truly intend to breakup. ..This is...powerful.. She's sometimes on the other side of the world when it comes to us communicating through our anxieties, but it's never been a problem for us because when it comes to this electric love, we are on the same page, always... We are tethered... I've never heard anyone speak so strongly before about what we share. I'm not worried about it--the love itself--for that is something that can't be broken. What I'm worried about is myself... I'm worried about her... I'm worried about an uncertain future. ..We both struggle with depression more than you could believe.. We have a pact to keep each other in this world. I can't keep writing this.

I don't know where I was going with this.

I don't know.

I can't do therapists. I can't talk to some empty, emotionless human who does it for a job. I just can't. Everyone here is faceless, behind a screen, and for someone as antisocial and distrusting as me, that is the most beautiful kind of human connection. To just see kind words here...

I'm in a bad place, people... I'm really in a bad place... I miss her. I am not like this often. I have an unhealthy pride that does not allow me to show myself like this, and yet here I am. I'll even admit that I've just started crying, and I am trying so hard to force these tears back inside.

...When you meet that person, you just know...

And it isn't rainbows and butterflies, people... Don't envy this... If you have anxiety and depression, don't envy this... It is so fucking terrifying to find the one you love and know that the both of you are not immortal but in fact very, very mortal... You begin to realize how fragile life is and how fleeting it is... I threw away four years that I could have kept my ex as my best friend and spent more time with the girl who makes my world whole. My soul is torn in pieces and deposited in different places, different times throughout these past 5 years... Part of me is dead and still back there in 2015 during that horrible, fateful moment that I left her... I see a certain color in the night air and I crumble because it takes me back to that moment. I watch a music video for a song I love, and I see a plane fly through the sky and it takes me back to last year when she had her head against my shoulder as we flew to San Francisco for her work. I'm just so fucking broken...

Inside I know... I KNOW that I will be with her again, but this has been so much time ... so much time has been wasted ...

...We lost our child...

I have to go.

I can't keep doing this. I can't keep writing.

I don't do this. My pride is killing me, and I need to abandon it, but I can't be weak. I'm going to feel weak. I've had bad things happen to me when I let my shield down. I had my father when I met this girl, and he's dead now. My mother is a piece of shit. I'm sorry, but don't you dare tell me to respect her. She had police point guns at me soon after his death and she watched as they did it. She even smiled. She's barely human. She goes back and forth, and she is one of the most bipolar people I know, yet I am nothing but kind to her, and I live in much closer proximity with her now than I had ever wished to at the age of 30.

Kind words... My pride is fucking killing me right now for asking this, but I just need kind words... I'm not okay... I'm not well...

I will not kill myself. I can't Not as long as she is here and alive...

I'm no longer crying...

I've written like this before, and I've deleted it all... I'm not going to this time...

I'm not comfortable with this, but maybe this is a good thing. Maybe this is a big step for me to take...

...I'm blocking things out... Things I've just written about, I'm blocking them out as I write this last line, and I have to. I've never been able to block things out before. Reality has always been right in my face. But it's getting so rough, that I'm beginning to block shit out.

Everyone here who supports one another and loves blindly and unconditionally through this ""faceless and emotionless"" screen... I love you... I have seen people bring one another up here in ways that make me almost have hope in humanity again...

And yet right around the corner, in some of these subs, people are so horrible to one another...

When will we fucking learn... ..I digress.. I have enough problems of my own without getting into deep, philosophical talks...

I am so uncomfortable with this. But, I'm going to post this.

What a rambling mess of a post... I'll leave this up for a while, but eventually, it's going to get deleted. Or perhaps, I'll just start using a different account. Who knows.

Please don't suggest medication. I was on that stuff for 7-8 or 9 years. I can't remember. All I know is that it really fucked me up.

I don't want a therapist. I just want to post here about random things, and not this, but I am today.

That's all I'll say. ...Well... Here goes.",severe
"At this point just genuinely curious what sort of shit 2020 throws my way : It's actually funny. I used to end every previous year with ""Okay, that was bad, but surely it can't get much worse!! You can only go up from rock bottom!1!!11!"", only to get fucked in the most unimaginable ways by the next year, to the point where I've mostly dissociated from my own existence and it's nothing more than a bad fucking movie. 



I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations!

Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  

Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up.

Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",severe
"Help. : I'm 24 and I'm useless, I have studies in programming and sadly had been fairly smart through my life, but it does not even matter.

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",severe

"I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it. Funny how the worst time of my life, now seems like it was the best.",severe

I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",severe

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery.

"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

"Going in and out of happy and depressed. : I feel like this has always been a thing with me. A lot of days I'm just depressed the entire day, but most of them (especially recently) I seem to move in and out of short bursts of mania and depression. One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind.",severe

"Coming to terms with the temporariness of it all. : My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication.

It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.
I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant. I hope anyone who currently feels as though they're in a trough can see that it won't always be this way, and there are sunnier days ahead.",severe

"Venting a bit : I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it’s felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism’s day depression. 
Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the “next page” button and it brought me to the payment section.
Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it’s a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn’t mention that until you’ve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, “okay what’s going on, what’s wrong? Oh no that’s unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I’m gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can’t afford it, well fuck off then.” 
It’s 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn’t ask for and wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don’t know where I’d be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being.

"Hating what I used to love : I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.
I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.
But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 
I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.
Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 
I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 
I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.
I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  
I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.",severe
"Depression from Chronic Iniury : Hi all, I’ve dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT.  
However I’ve had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself.   I can’t play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well.  When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. 
I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries.

"I’m starting to feel like I’m not meant for this world anymore : I’m 17, and I’ve been feeling this way ever since I was 15. I have no friends, social anxiety and I’ve been homeschooled since I was 5. And to top it all off, I have asperger’s syndrome. I’d give away everything I have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal.
My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can barely even go out anymore. I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don’t think I’ll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I’m sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason.

Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can’t do anything else.

"Can I leave some baggage here : Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.
Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone",severe
"(UK) Can I get sectioned if I ‘m not a danger to myself or anyone else? : Basically I’m 16 and my dad keeps on telling me I’m going to get sectioned if I don’t take the antidepressant that I was given or continue going to therapy (I don’t want to anymore, not helping me). I have THOUGHT about killing myself but I never would because I love my pets. I don’t physically self-harm either.
I don’t see how I’m a danger to myself or anyone else so there’s no reason to get sectioned, right?",severe
"I was told it gets better, 10 years later and it just got numb. : So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.
There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.
So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.
I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.
Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.
It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.
But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.
So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

"My family doesn't validate or accept my feelings, so I don't either. : Over the years, I've been called lazy for wanting to lie in bed, a baby for breaking down and crying, and selfish for wanting any time to myself. 
When they suspected that I was doing bad things to myself, I was also told that I would burn in hell for it.
I was diagnosed with depression, and even the doctor didn't really seem to care. 
So I guess I don't either. I don't take care of myself as much as I should because I'm losing my will to change. To be better. 
I'm starting to think that I really am just as useless as my family thinks I am.",severe
"I Don’t Care About Living Anymore : Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. 
I don’t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn’t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I’ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 
There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I’m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can’t live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I’m all of those things, and I can’t stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can’t take it anymore.
Right now I’m on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I’m going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There’s a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don’t care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It’s not even that I’m suicidal. I’m not trying to kill myself. But if that’s what ends up happening, I don’t care. I just don’t want to be here.",severe
"We take our victories when we can. : This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.
It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.
I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).
7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).
Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.
I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)
My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

"Chronic Harm OCD sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice? : Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.
I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.",severe
"Hi : I need help. I haven’t been happy since I was 8 years old. Here I am 4 years later trying to get out of the depression hole I dug for myself. Therapy won’t help. It’s to the point where everyday for the past three months I have thought about suicide. I lost three of my best friends already. I only have a couple friends left. I used to cry myself to sleep but now I just sit for hours on end thinking and searching for a reason to live. I can’t cry anymore, no matter how much I try. I don’t need any pms telling me that life is worth living. I don’t need lies saying that people love me. If they loved me they wouldn’t hurt me and throw me away like garbage. If they loved me I wouldn’t be in the situation I am in right now. I fake my happiness so that they don’t worry about me. I build an armor around my heart to protect myself and others. I try to build a wall but it doesn’t work. I just keep falling deeper and deeper into my hole. I lost, angry and I tired. Tired of being here. I don’t need people to constantly check up on me.

"Complete dissatisfied human being. : So I‘m a bit excited about doing a post about it. I‘m struggling from severe depression since I‘m 11. I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.
Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 
Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again.

"forcing myself to appreciate my progress : Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:
1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

"I tried to kill myself yesterday and wanna quit the meds, long post : So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"".

"I think this is my final straw and I am scared : Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.
I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.
I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.
I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.
I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.
When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)
This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.
Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 
Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 
I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.
I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 
The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 
About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.
I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 
We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 
I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.
It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.
So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 
The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 
Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 
I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.",severe

I was forgetting where I was, who I was talking to. This horror lasted 2 hours. After I finally took Klonopin the symptoms stopped.  I'm relatively a healthy person.

"I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me. : So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.
You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.
TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.",severe

"Where will I end up if I know I can't deal with life and don't want to kill myself. : I've suffered with depression my entire life and never did much to overcome it early on when I should have.  I will turn 30 soon and I have been addicted to porn since I was 12. I used porn as a safe coping mechanism so that I wouldn't have to deal with anything in life- improving social skills and having friendships, taking risks, developing hobbies, talking to girls and dating, going to college, traveling. Ive done none of these things. I've had a few menial jobs and have an apartment. That's it.
Now I have no job, I am a virgin and I have no friends. I just quit watching porn a month ago, but I am more depressed than I have ever been. This is because when I cut my coping mechanism being porn addiction out of your routine, reality hit me like a brick wall. Everything is bubbling to the surface and I am fully overwhelmed by the fact that I have completely wasted my young life. I see absolutely no positive reason to move forward. I have never felt this close to suicide being the only way out before. I am seeing shrinks about my problems and got put on meds recently this month. Therapy is not helping and you know meds just numb the pain a bit. They don't do anything to improve me without me trying to improve myself. But it's gotten to the point where I have no desire to improve myself AT ALL!! I can't get out of bed, can't eat. can't go outside. I have no passion to do anything. I know I can't commit suicide but I don't want to move or think. 
I've been in a crisis unit at a local hospital 5 years ago and it did nothing to help me. All they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for 2 weeks straight before they released me. All this did for me was numb the pain with medication and I was just as unhappy as I was before I went in. 
So my question is what happens when you don't want to kill yourself, but you can't deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? Is there a place where they will put you where you don't have to leave your bed? Psych ward or something?  I want to be put away forever. I can't deal with the uphill battle I will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. I do not have any strength left to improve myself at all. I do not want to be released from the care of others. Where do they put someone like me at his point. Any advice?",severe
"I’m tired of fighting : I’ve spent years fighting against depression, ptsd, generalised anxiety disorder and an eating disorder. I’ve had support from the local mental health team done tons of therapy throughout the years. Medication the lot. But I still think of ending my life everyday. Sometimes it’s less intense and other times it’s highly intense. 
I’ve stopped talking to any family about how I feel because I get comments a lot if i do about how to effects them. Although I have a complex diagnosis I am not a person who creates toxic environments for them. It’s almost as if my very existence is a reminder that they failed me as a child to protect me. I do understand it must be really hard for them. They’re the only reason I havnt fully gone through with a suicide attempt because I wouldn’t want to break my mums heart I know she would blame herself but I’m getting to the end of my 20s and I’m incredibly tired or feeling this way. 
When I try and do something just for myself it upsets someone in the family for example if I say I’m going to go out with my brother who is around my own age to go watch a band or distract myself by other siblings who chose to have families say “oh you never want to spend time with me” it’s like nothing I do is right. I feel like I’m living for everybody else but what I really want is to just not live. 
I feel incredibly stuck in life i live in a box room can’t afford to move out. I just stay in my room 90% of the time every night I say to myself stay in the moment be mindful tomorrow is a new day. But when I wake up it’s the same feelings.

"Not really sure what to say kinda new to this : So I'm not super good at being open, but lately it's hard to go through a hour, especially at work without some form of crying spell. Since where I'm at the cost of getting a therapy session in takes for ever, or they want to charge a arm and a leg. Which I dont have since struggling with money since I'm the only that works currently in the family.
Figured I'd try anything at this point since even though it's legal in my current state I don't want to rely on drugs for a crutch. I know they work wonders on people and people swear by it, its just not for me. Then I've gone cold turkey with alchol since I figured in this current state that also wasnt the best idea to keep it in the house. So I've been sober since last october, but the longer I live here the harder it is for me. Like it's hard to explain since in my mind, I know people are going through this with me and there are people who have it worse then me. That all dosnt seem to matter though and I cant shake it off me.
I've been kinda slowly I'm depressed over the last 3 years, and it just gets harder each day, there are some good days though. Even some good weeks like went down south to look at houses, and for the week and a half I didnt have any kinda crying spell or anything. Felt like me and it was great, then came back up here and it's been really rough on me. The mood swings have been worse and I've been distancing myself from my wife, and closing myself off to the outside. All I can do is just watch and I feel helpless to do anything about it, minus just cry which I've been doing for the past hour in my office toilet.
Then got to thinking maybe there is a reddit where I can kinda just talk, even if it's to myself for a little bit. I really dont know much coping skills or even methods. Which I've been looking into, and take some cbd gummies even though they dont really do much for me I feel. I'm just trying anything really to get over this hump and find the path back to feeling like me. So figured maybe this could be therapeutic maybe I'm not really sure. I also dont feel hate or anything like that, like it's just feeling numb at times, and feeling like I'm alone even if my wife is litterly a finger away from me. 
I guess some of it could be contributed to my first parrot, which was given to my by now wife like 7 years ago at this point. Which unfortunately she died after the move due to stress and complications of it. Then I got another bird after some time of grieving since birds make me happy and what not. She unfortunately died due to stress after our basement flooded. That could be a huge factor to how I feel up here. I'm not sure but thanks for listening and I hope all have a great day.",severe

"Just got prescribed Prozac. Could I still have small/moderate quantities of alcohol? : Hi,
I was just prescribed Prozac today and I wondering if I could still drink/smoke while on it. I’m in college and enjoy a drink every once in a while, as well as getting drunk/sometimes smoking at parties (though not as often as I used to.) I understand that depression meds intensify the effects of alcohol/marijuana. If I were to have smaller doses than I usually consume (I.e. limiting myself to one drink at all times) would that be a problem, or should I avoid other substances altogether?

"a relapse : I had a major depressive episode that lasted almost a whole fucking year and a few months ago I felt so sure that the nightmare ended and that I could finally start living a normal life.I did feel so much better.I started going to a therapist and working on my issues .I managed to stay focused and do really well at school .I started feeling a lot more confident in myself and  I even felt real happiness . I was in a really good place for about 4 months .I was so sure that I would never feel the way I felt when I had a major depressive episode again ,that I would not fall back into that dark pit .And I was so proud of myself for overcoming depression.
     And then ,a month ago,some shitty things happened to me.It made me feel powerless ,helpless .I  couldn’t come to terms with the fact that something so completely out of my control happened to me.And even though I promised to myself that I wouldn’t let that shit interfere with the progress I was making ,it did interfere.I just couldn’t help it .The damage was not done overnight .It was bringing me down slowly ,day by day .
   At first, I thought I was doing just fine.But then i caught myself having persistent thoughts that once made me decide to take my own life .Then I found myself having difficulty concentrating on my studies ,even though I absolutely love studying and learning new things .Then I started sleeping too much because the incessant flow of thoughts and overthinking made me feel exhausted  .The headaches started.Getting out of bed was becoming more and more difficult.And at a certain point I was so overwhelmed by my feelings that I just literally turned my emotions off .I didn’t feel anything .I felt numb and empty.I guess i kind of felt like I had to resort to turning  the emotions off  because keeping up an act of being ok with all the thoughts eating away at me all the time was difficult as hell.My mom started noticing that I was skipping school and staying in my bed all day instead .I could tell she was afraid that I was in a really dark place again.And I just couldn’t put her through that pain again.She suffered enough because of me.So I numbed my feeling and started attending school regularly .The whole numbing my emotions thing was working out just fine for me.I went to school .I didn’t think about anything ,I didn’t feel anything ,it’s like I was there but my mind was somewhere else . I tried to put a smile on whenever my mom was around .
    Obviously I couldn’t keep escaping from my own thoughts forever .This would have been way too easy to be true . A few day’s ago all the thoughts I tried so hard to avoid  just burst out and it feels so fucking overwhelming .
   I just can’t believe that I am feeling all this shot again .I was so sure that the nightmare had ended .
   I doubt someone finished reading this because it came out way too longer than I expected ,but anyways I just wanted to share this with someone because there’s literally nobody I can talk to.I just needed to get this out of my system.
   Whoever is reading this ,I hope that you’ll find enough strength to keep going no matter what .

"It's like teachers got worse after being told I have anxiety and depression : ( This is a bit of a post to get rid of my anger )
I talked to my school guidanc councilor and she told the principal that I was going to therapy for depression and anxiety. She told teachers to consider that when giving out to me for certain things. Like I get really tired because of my mental illness so I get snappy at teachers when they annoy me so they basically give me more of a chance or something.
So I have cbas ( classroom based assessment ) they are basically small projects that go towards your junior certificate and im really stressing over them cuz they give some percentage of my tests. So I was working on my computer turned off. I went to the teacher kinda panicked because I had 3 days to finish ( I'm finished now :D ) and I needed computer to work I told him this and he sat me in a corner of the room and gave me paper and told me to work on I couldn't so just doodled on the paper and got lunch time detention. This was maths.
Then in English I was sleeping after finishing my work. This teacher is usually really understanding. He came up to me slapped the table next to me and said if you wanna sleep get out of my God damn class lemme see your work. Showed him the work he told me it was about what he expected from a 3 year old. I re write it he says it's terrible and that I need to do it for homework. Next day I did more than he wanted me to do ( 250  word essay expected and I done 300 - 350 ) he says he couldn't read the writing and that I need to do it AGAIN I refused got kicked out of class had to go to the principal and she said I should work to his standards.

"I was, and am, scared of getting better : Before I was out (I'm ftm) I was severely depressed for years, and was even suicidal for a while. I hated it, all I  wanted was to feel okay most days and when I came out, it was like a flip switched in my brain. I wasn't just okay, I was genuinely happy most days. I hadn't felt that good since I was 7 at the absolute oldest. In some ways, I felt like a completely different person; I became more empathetic, my grades went up, I had more motivation then maybe ever before, I completely stopped doing self harm, including pinching, which is something I started doing as a form of self harm when I was around 8, but I was still me in the sense of personality. For once, I truely felt like myself. That said though, the bad days became so much worse; I wasn't used to it, it wasn't my norm anymore. I'm still so grateful to have been able to experience that, to know what it felt like to function normally. When things first started to get better trough, that was exactly what I was afraid of. That it would be worse when things got bad, and if it got really bad again, I wasn't sure if I even would be able to recover. To an extent, I was right. Now, the period of constant okayness is ending. I'm having less and less good days, and it's awful. I'm having more breakdowns than I did when I was suicidal, and when it happens now, I almost always get really close to passing out, and that never happened before.

"Retro-active suffering? : Over the past three years my emotional and mental health have worsened. I’ve struggled with self harm, alchohol and a few other destructive habits. Everyone around me was fine blaming this on a the passing of a close loved one, nice and simple cause. But over the past three years I’ve slowly been suspecting that some of my character flaws and bad habits aren’t as simple as what I initially thought they were. So maybe instead of being lazy/stupid (I still believe those are issues that I’m working very hard on.) maybe it has something to do with the intense spiraling fear I have of confrontation, anxiety, poor, very poor self image. 
Basically it feels like as I’ve had depression/anxiety/trauma/negative behavior patterns explained to me by friends/media/ and cultural osmosis.... I ended up going “huh, that clinical description of anxiety sounds a little familiar in a frightening sense.” I do and feel things that sound insane when I describe them to myself. But at the time I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by these things. I’ll abuse physically and emotionally myself, feel swallowed by panic, fear and intense doubt just by a minor argument, or trying something new that will be good for me. 
I’ve never described myself as someone who struggles with depression as I was growing up. But I realize now that I hurt myself in so many ways not just physically. Is it possible that I’ve always had these mal-adjusted traits and I’m just now learning to express them properly? 
Sorry if this is stupid and rambling. I’m not trying to claim any undeserved attention. I know there are people with much more to struggle with. I am doing better the past few months. I’ve been working hard on my self and where I’m at in life. I just worry sometimes I’ll always have these destructive tendencies inside me.",severe
"Methylphenidate in depression : &amp;#x200B;
Hi everyone! I finally decided to join reddit and hope that I chose the correct subreddit.  
Maybe some general info: I am a 23-year-old female student. I was diagnosed with depression last year (have had it since I was 15, but I never took it seriously unfortunately, thought I was just lazy etc, last year I finally decided to get some help as I was barely functional…) Anyways, I started CBT some months ago and while it is not bad, I wanted to try something medication-wise, but I am very sceptical about SSRIs which are still the first line of treatment. I read about methylphenidate being used off-label sometimes in depression and wanted to try it because of the depression and the concentration troubles I have had for a very long time. I got a small amount of 10 mg pills from someone (no, not a doctor...) and tried one yesterday. I started at 5 mg, after a while I felt my surroundings to be a bit “dimmed”, but no improve in focus, so I took the other 5 mg. Then I got calm and relaxed, my anxiety (which I had not really noticed before) was gone and after the effects wore off, I felt like I had just done something very relaxing and fell asleep. Nothing productive done during the time it worked, unfortunately.
So today I started with the full 10 mg pill. Nothing. Not even side effects (yesterday I had cold hands and some thirst). I took another one an hour after the first.
I got a bit calm again, but barely felt the difference, then tried to meditate. I then took another one, again nothing!! Just feeling a bit sleepy now.
Could someone maybe comment on why I reacted like this? I know it would be only a theory but I am very curious. I will give back the remaining pills I have and do not intend to try it out more, as I feel at 30 mg I should have noticed something. I know that ritalin only inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, so maybe I was low in them in the beginning? I would be willing to try maybe wellbutrin or a MAO inhibitor, but I doubt I can just get them “on demand” (whereas I would easily get an SSRI etc.)
I feel like what I experienced yesterday sounds more like what medications that work on GABA do. 
I know that self-medication isn’t the way to go but given the fact that ritalin wears off so quickly I just wanted to give it a shot, mainly because of depression/focus issues and high distractibility. I know that it is “abused” by students for more focus etc. and I would have loved it if it worked like that, but I really can’t see how from my experiences :D. Also, I do not react to caffeine anymore, I remember my first cup of coffee as well as my first energy drink, I was so alert and calm/could order my thoughts better. Even after some weeks of caffeine abstinence I do not get these effects anymore.
I will probably go to my GP soon and also talk to my psychologist; I am just curious if any of you have had similar effects (without having AD(H)D).
Sorry for the long post!",severe
"I am 350 pounds, clinically depressed and hate my own existence. : I’m 350 pounds, 5 foot 9 and thanks to a 100 pound weight loss 5 years ago now partially balding :( of course gained the weight back. I’m clinically depressed though lately I’ve gotten some medication that helps somewhat though it still hits hard. 
I’ve always been overweight ever since I was little. At 22 I managed to turn things around and go from 310 to 180 pounds in 14 months. I tried to date in college at that point, but after nothing but constant rejection by being flat out ignored what little self esteem I got from losing weight fell apart. Just in my last year or college I tried to lull myself 5 times though chickened out right before success. Then over the next two years I put the weight back on and am now 350. 
Physical attractiveness has always been something that has been the most important to me because it was the one thing I never had. I’ve been told in the past I’m handsome, funny, witty, caring, and hard working, but none of that gets a girlfriend. Even if I am handsome my weight makes me a 2/10 at the very best. 
Nothing that I am matters so long as I am the way that I am. 26 years in and not once have I gotten one phone number let alone a date. At this point all I can see myself as is a blight. I hate my own existence with everything I have because I am everything that I don’t want to be. None of the positive traits people have said about me have done anything for me in getting the one thing I want most, a companion. All because the one thing women value most is what I have never had and seem doomed to never have. I regret every single day I didn’t kill myself back in 2016 because now I don’t have the guts to even try it.",severe

I don't want to commit suicide because of my mother, no one should have to bury their child but I can't predict how much longer this barrier will be enough. I feel soon this will be overwhelming. I'm a shade of the person I used to be. 
For the first few years of my depression I maintained a hope that I would get better given time and effort, I was optimistic even though I felt like shit. I don't feel this any more. Even if I were to feel better with time or effort I don't care any more. I don't want to be better I just want to die.

"FIRST POST! : # So I found this Sub-Reddit a year ago and I had nothing to share about my depression, but now, I really want to share my experience about it and I think I would feel a bit better sharing with you. P.S.- Sorry for my 'not so fluent' English!
I am just a regular teenager from Dhaka, Bangladesh and well, I had a really happy and sweet childhood. My life turned upside down when I turned 16 a couple of years ago. Before then, my parents were kind to me and understood what I wanted the most, and I had lots of friends. Therefore, I had enjoyed a really good life.
* I was in Grade 8 and I had a crush on my batch mate. Unfortunately, I cannot tell her name due to my insecurities. She was nice, beautiful and always had a 'radiating glow' face. My feelings grew for her and so in early 2017, I have decided to tell her about my feelings. I never knew that it was for my immaturity that it had to cost a lot. Without any consciousness, I went 'too fast', asking her out. The consequence? Well, an usual rejection. I was too dumb to understand the reason why she rejected me, yet, I kept on asking her what was the reason behind. The entire school got to know about this and I have insulted by my friends a lot. They used to tell me that she was way beyond my league or I absolutely don't deserve her, but the most hurtful one was that some of my batch mates used to call me GAY or even worse FAGGOT, since to them, I can never date someone. One day, I was so pissed listening to the same insults that I created a scene inside the class in front of her and her friends. I had to take the fall, and people used to label me as a ""LUNATIC"" and called me GAY more often. I could not tell it to my parents and I kept it shun until 2018. That is the beginning where I started to feel frustrated and depressed.
* The days were getting worse when my academic results started to decline in Grade 9 and at that time, I had a year left for my O-Levels examinations. My mother, who used to be my biggest supporter and best friend, started to show cruelty and she used to impose harsh rules and even curfew at home. She even insulted me each and everyday, always compared my abilities to others who are far more successful than me. I always wished to have a good recreational time during the weekends and my mother never let me have one. My father, who admired me the most, started to feel the same like my mother and supported what my mother said directed to me. However, it was my elder sister who has supported me throughout my dark times and I was and still am grateful having her. I felt so diminished and unfortunate seeing my friends having such supporting parents whereas mine never appreciated who I am. I felt so lost having no partners beside whom i can share how much pain I was suffering from.
* Fast forward to 2019 and my O-Levels exams had concluded. Unlike, many kids, my summer vacation went bleakly and had no form of fun until our family had spent a little quality holiday trip in India. Unlucky that my O-Levels had to published during that time, my time in India went dull. The good news was that I got 2A\*s and 4As and my parents were ""extremely"" happy till they got to know that there were more people who got way better results than me. After hearing it, they were  a bit sad at first. Three months later, my mother got the very opportunity to insult me with the very result I put too much effort on. I cried for a week without them knowing and since then, the feeling of being A SORE LOSER has started to grow gradually.
* My O Levels results has become a turning point in my life. Not only I let my parents down, but I lost my friends. After the results were published, it seemed like all of my friends hate me and I got negligible attention from my friends even more. Two of my best friends now do not talk to me often and they are now of their own business. My other friends formed a group of theirs, leaving me behind. The worst part is that I am now inferior to them. Every day since, I have been a helpless victim of bullying and mental torture. It's sad to know that one of my closest friends have even started to traumatize me with my shameful past incidents in front of people.
Now, I have grown more stressed, hopeless and weakened than ever. I have never felt so much isolation and gloom in my entire life. I had continual suicidal thoughts and even attempted once, but I must not make my family sad. Amidst all these, I must show my smiling face to my elders and everyone. Why? In case of our so called ""brown community"", there is no such thing as ""depression"", and funny thing is that all it takes is just a glass of water to just cure your depression. How disgraceful my own society is!
I know I made this too long and boring as it is my first time I am sharing with you people but I desperately need some eager audience who could actually understand how depression looks like from a country filled with filth and corruption. This might sound too weird but I believe that sharing my own narrative can somewhat help to grow and rebuild a beautiful life again as I had in my childhood. Thank you.
P.S.- I had gone through several therapies but as I said, the psychologists as well are DUMBFUCKS. They told me to drink water and take breathing sessions, which made absolutely no sense at ALL!!!
Amidst the dark cloud, however, there is always a silver lining. I would like to thank to my inspiring friends who read my situations and understood what sort of hell I was going through. Without them, my life would have been more miserable and filled with more regrets. They have encouraged me alot and I'll never forget for what they've done for me. 
I hope you would also understand what I try to interpret through this long, (scrambled) post!",severe
"My story. : On Feb 1st I decided I was done fighting. I couldn't take anymore. I grabbed as many medications as I could and started swallowing pills. This would be my 5th attempt. The difference this time was that my wife and son were home. My wife knew about my other attempts but had never actually seen or caught me before. This time she caught me. I saw the pain and hurt on her face. The raw emotion. She immediately called 911 and tried to stop me. It had never occurred to me just how much something like this would hurt her. I couldn't take it. I left the house and started walking. Waiting for the medications to take affect. For something to happen. I was met on the street by an officer, followed by a couple more and then an ambulance. I tried to lie to them and tell them I wasn't who they were looking for but they ultimately got me to hand over my license and found out the truth. I was taken to a hospital and forced to drink activated charcoal. I do not recommend this. The taste was horrible. After 3 cups full of the stuff they decided to watch me. I wasn't allowed to be alone. Not even to change clothes into the hospital scrubs. I understand why. And since I'm a diabetic and some of the medications I swallowed were for diabetes they had to check my blood sugar every 15 minutes. That in itself was not a wonderful experience. Left with nothing but my thoughts and the annoyed hospital staff that had to watch me I got to relive the memory of my wife finding me over and over. The hurt I saw will haunt me for years. I was finally moved to the ICU where they could keep a close eye on me and make sure the charcoal was doing it's job. I met with multiple psych doctors over the next 3 days. All asking the same boring questions. Still being poked and checked, but at least it had been changed to every hour. Even throughout the night I was checked. This made it almost impossible to sleep. Finally it was decided that I was a danger to myself for now and I was moved to the psych ward. At least there I had some privacy. Though I was still checked on every 15 minutes to make sure I was safe. I attended groups and the therapy there. They adjusted my anti-depressant medication and my mood stabilizer. After many long talks with my wife and the therapists I was let out. Almost 2 weeks later. The medication helps but is not a cure. I'm working with a therapist in outpatient twice a week and I'm fighting to reclaim my marriage and show my family I'm here for the long run. There are still bad days but I remember the pain I did cause and would have caused on more family and I continue to fight. I'm not sure why I'm writing this but it does help. For anyone out there know you are loved and you will be missed if anything happens to you. You aren't alone. We are all fighters.",severe
i want to scream : i’m so angry all the time anymore. as long as i’ve had MDD (more than 8 years now) i’ve been so tired. that tired that sleep can’t fix. my job makes me miserable but it’s the only one in my area that pays well enough to give me an opportunity out. my situation makes me miserable. everything makes me tired. everything seems like an effort. i want to scream and break down almost every day and i just don’t have the energy or am at work and have to hold it all in for my 14 hour days. i’ve never been an addict but it’s still a struggle not to throw my life away to drugs in order to stop feeling this way. i know all my therapy in theory but nothing seems to work in practice. words can’t describe how much i hate this. the worst is mentally begging for help that isn’t there because in reality the only one who can fix me is me. i just want to lay down forever in my warm safe bed and fall asleep and never wake up,severe

"i know my mom loves me but.... shes sometimes just too unbearable... : i recently finally opened up to mom that i am interested in signing up to a rehab. mostly because i wanted proper psych evaluation and felt the need of structured life to deal with depression and alcohol. now, i must say that i dont have severe alcohol dependance. i dont have withdrawal nor crave for it. i just tend to socialize at bars often because there isnt anything to do around where i live. 
i wanted to talk about rehab without sounding like im mental, mostly because i didnt wanna worry her. she often overreacts and overreach with things. as expected, she asked me if i am gonna be locked up in a psych ward. i explained to her what it was and what i would be doing in there. 
but since then she just casually says things like “gee, when are you gonna deal with your addiction?” and it breaks me. 
she also knows i smoke weed sometimes to sleep. i maybe go through a pinch a week and only to help with sleeping. i never do it in public and i never talk about it. ive told her this every time she brings it up. i never become irresponsible to daily chores/work because of alcohol or weed.
today i had an anxiety attack. i had to go out to translate for her doctors visit and it hit me. after the clinic visit, she wanted me to take her to a local car shop to get her a pair of new tires but i told her that i can do it tomorrow. i rushed home and she called to insist to get the tires done right now. i couldnt explain what i was going through because i was scared shes gonna bring it up later like its nothing and that she wouldnt understand. she started to get frustrated, understandably, and started to raise her voice. she asked if i am too high on drugs to help. then i broke down. i told her that i am just not feeling well while crying. she just replied with “sigh, okay” then hung up. 
now i really wanna go to a rehab. just leave and maybe find a job and live alone.",severe
Selenium and Magnesium can help a lot with depression : I have depression myself it’s been very severe for a while but I’ve done research on what causes the chemical imbalances and how to fix them as well as what else is wrong. Mercury seems to be the main cause of depression and all mental illness but Selenium and Magnesium can get rid of it over the course of months. These two minerals are both antioxidants themselves and also both increase Glutathione which is the most important antioxidant in the body. Antioxidants fight oxidative a which is a major factor in depression. Selenium also increases metallothionein which is crucial for a good blood-brain barrier and protection from heavy metals. I’m taking these right now although only recently started but I just wanted to tell whoever sees this that there are a lot of different supplements that can help immensely with depression because they help the body deal with what’s wrong and what’s lacking. I highly recommend anybody struggling like me to start taking these two supplements it can’t hurt it can help a lot it could even cure your depression if it is from mercury toxicity like it is a lot of the time.,severe
The weed is not even working anymore and I'm scared : I don't know what to do anymore. I have 0 friends and no family I can talk to. I don't go to therapy or take antidepressants so I've been self medicating and calming my depression with weed.  It usually helps to stabilize me even a few days after I smoke it but yesterday I smoked it and today I just have the worst anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I  haven't had it this bad for a little while now. I'm scared the weed is not working anymore. This is all I had left and if it's not working my suicidal thoughts are coming back stronger than ever and I'm scared. It doesn't help that I take the train everyday when I'm already suicidal.  I keep getting the urge to go jump in front of it. I have self control but these urges are just taking over rn. It's  so bad I don't know what to do.,severe

The worst points were in 2013 when I broke my knee for the second time in two years and 2017 when my high school sweetheart of 5 years left me. In late 2018 I got into a new relationship and everything was going extremely well and I couldnt have been happier however, a month ago she left me and look I know that things happen and that sometimes people fall out and things dont work, but there were no signs that it was gonna happen... anyway I know I gotta move on, I need no help there but I'll say this hurts alot and my depression and anxiety have started to strangle me again. 
I wanna admit finally that over the past 10 years, every so often I contemplate suicide. I know I'll never act on it but it's always there. I know that it's just a transfer of pain to the people around me... but honestly, it's always been there... I dont know why either. Everything around me can be going well and I still have the thought... and again, I wont act on it because i know that it will hurt other people... but i just want the pain to stop... I'm not social enough to go out with friends and have fun but I know sitting around isnt good for me... idk I just wanted to get that off my chest and maybe get some advice on what to do... recently it seems like every other day i think about ending it... i just want it to stop...",severe
"How do you know if the medication is working ? : Can you feel a difference ? What it's supposed to happen ? 
After one year of medication (anti depressant) I just changed a month ago.
We changed because I told my doctor I did not feel a difference and he said that if I was not feeling worst, it was already something. I know it's not supposed to be magic but it has to do something.",severe
"Constantly regretting past decisions, can’t get over them, what to do?? : Idk if this is the best sub but I kinda need to vent/rant (again) while also sort of seeking advice. I am currently living in a state of constant regret over my decision as to where I went to college, and I cannot get over this regret no matter what. Even when I go through days of not minding it (usually because busy schoolwork and studying has me distracted), the pain of regret always comes back. I try to look for advice, but all I’m ever told is that I “just have to move on,” or that I “just have to get over it.” But that’s where my problem is because I just can’t. My question is *how*. How do I?
I’m a second semester freshman in undergrad college. When it came down to making a decision, I was left to choose between a large, decent urban commuter university in my city where my best friends were attending and dorming together (there’s some on-campus dorms) or a small T50 liberal arts college, and I chose the liberal arts college because of its better rankings, better reputation (I think), and because I thought I would want to attend a liberal arts college. In hindsight, while I do like the smaller classes and personable relationships with professors, who really care that all their students succeed, I’m not so sure if I care so much about the liberal arts education as compared to a larger university. My family heavily pressured me to go to a liberal arts school because they thought it would be the best for me, and because I’m undecided and undeclared, and when it came to decisions, they heavily pushed me towards choosing the liberal arts college, so I did, though I had also done my own research and consideration too to be fair. I forewent living with my best friends at the city university for the completely new liberal arts college, which at least on paper seemed to be good because you always hear that college is supposed to be that time of personal growth and you discover yourself and who you are and what you like.
I’ve struggled with social anxiety pretty much all my life, and while I haven’t been medically diagnosed with depression (though I haven’t really sought out a diagnosis either), I do have a lot of seemingly depressive episodes, thoughts, and the traits common and seen among depressed people (so I’m really sorry if I come across presumptuous here, I know lots of people actually struggle with depression and have been diagnosed). A lot of people look forward to college but I was the opposite. Completely nervous and anxious. I wanted to go with my best friends because, well, they were my best friends and I thought that could help make the transition for me to college a lot easier. I still want(ed) to personally grow and develop, make new friends, meet new people, discover myself, and all that crap, but I believed as someone with social anxiety that would help make me more confident in my place (though I also feared complacency). 
Towards the latter half of my high school career, I was blessed to finally find a “friend group,” having been pretty much lonely all my life with maybe one or two friends at a time. But even among that friend group, I only really had, like, two really close friends - everyone else is a friend, but more so the kind I just hang out with, you know? It happened that those two close friends of mine (as well as another friend of ours) were going to dorm together at the city university and I was really tempted to do that too, live with them, but my family told me (and I told myself) that would be wrong, I was just being motivated by my short-term desires and would just be following my friends. But on the other hand, I thought it could benefit me in the long-term too because it could make me more socially confident (after finding my friend group in high school I definitely became more confident, not 100%, but comparably more open and comfortable than before, but now I’ve completely regressed again). Plus I didn’t really think I was “following my friends” in the sense you usually hear, like a boyfriend foregoing a really great education for a field he was passionate in just to go to a school with his girlfriend that had his desired program but it wasn’t as good apparently, because I honestly had (and still don’t) no idea what I want(ed) to major in or do with my life as a career. But I was worried about foregoing the opportunity to attend that better ranked liberal arts college, and ultimately I chose it, not out of happiness or excitement but because I thought maybe it would be best for me, and I feared losing that opportunity to attend.
Fast-forward and I am completely depressed here. I have no friends and am completely lonely. I put in effort to make friends at first and I failed, and I have no energy to do so anymore, and I’m even starting to lose the desire and motivation to (although I don’t want to be lonely either). Partly due to being burnt out from the extremely rigorous academics at this school (it has a reputation for being so), but also due to what I perceive to be my depressive state. I’m considering transferring back but I don’t know if I should really, I’m scared to miss out on potential opportunities for networking or growth that I could have in the future if I stayed here but if I left, and also because I’d be transferring down (lower ranked school, less prestigious, not as strong as a reputation I think). But a little part of me says that I just need to find a way to persevere and push through, and transferring would be weak and be giving up, or otherwise a mistake in some aspect, be it personal growth or future/career aspects. I don’t know what to do, but either way if I stay I find myself constantly regretting not going to that city school and dorming with really my only close friends, and while I could if I transferred, I don’t know if I should or if that would be wise. And I’m worried if I do transfer I will regret that or it will harm me in the long-run or it’ll be some mistake or something. I’ve thought about therapy but I just can’t bring myself to muster up the energy to go see a counselor, and when I do have the energy then I just feel like I’m exaggerating all this or they won’t help and it’ll just make me more anxious (bc it’s a school counselor, so they want me to stay, but also bc therapy hasn’t helped me in the past when I’ve tried it).
If you read all this, thanks. I just don’t know what to do, and even for the “what’s” that I do know, I don’t know the “hows for me” if that makes any sense.",severe
"When to know you’re antidepressants isn’t working? : I’ve been on Venlafaxine 150mg since October, you would think my depression would have gone away by now? I’m also BP and taking Lamotrigine 50mg it’s been 4 weeks now. 
Nonetheless, I’m still fucking depressed. No motivation for anything. Exhausted as hell even if I had 8 hours of sleep. I even tried getting more or less sleep and I’m still fucking tired and dread getting out of bed. I’m not happy and have to fake it all day. 
My medication isn’t working right? I should be happy by now? I should be motivated? Do I up my medicine or try a different one? Does anyone take uppers for energy? Vitamins? Give me the secret to wake up feeling refreshed and wanting to do simple task like showering and brushing your teeth.",severe

I know it’s an NDRI, but I’m not sure this is how it’s supposed to function? Shouldn’t increased Norepinephrine and dopamine levels increase my alertness, focus, and motivation? 
I have an appointment with a new psych to discuss in a few weeks, so that’s covered. I’m not looking for medical advice but rather personal experiences and educational information.
I’m trying to educate myself before meeting with my new psych to hopefully find a better solution.",severe

"I can accept my anxiety but not my depression : I’ve lived my whole life with clinical anxiety; looking back, my parents acknowledged they saw it from the very beginning. It sucks but I don’t know anything different, so I can only guess how nice it must be to live with normal levels of anxiety. 
But I developed clinical depression as an adult and *knowing* what it’s like to live without it has made every day since a living hell. I feel like a walking corpse. I feel I’ve been robbed of life.

"Angry at my wife for no reason : I know I suffer from depression, and have been on anti depressants. (I've been off them for years now which was a struggle at first).

The following day she asked me some questions because she knew I was upset, to lighten the mood.  Well, I blew up on her again.  I am currently not talking to her over something so little and for no reason.  Shes a great wife and friend and very supportive and I'm just an asshole.  Problem I'm having is changing my mood and manning up to apologize.  There is no reason for me to be depressed or angry at everything but I am.

"Will anti-depressants change my personality? Newbie here. : I finally got prescribed anti-depression medication from the doctor today. It seemed ""too easy"". He had me fill out a sheet of paper, and based on my answers prescribed me a once a day pill. I oftentimes talk myself out of needing medication, out of fear of side effects and fear it will change my personality or how I see the world. This is the main reason I have never tried cigarettes, drugs, etc.
However, I cannot deny I have been feeling unwell for *ever* and have not been taking care of myself, my home, or my relationships. Clothes all over the house, dirty dishes piling up, and all my energy goes to work. The few times i actually take care of my things, i crash and go into a ""activity coma"" for the following days until it piles up so bad that I avoid home altogether, or do another cleaning burst until I crash again.
I'm scared to start medication, as I live alone and I worry I will not notice my side effects. I'm also very scared it will change how I perceive the world.

"Pressure to hold up your image : I haven't been diagnosed until recently, but I've definitely had depression for at least a few years. I finally went to the doctor and was prescribed zoloft. I have only told the 2 closest people in my life. I really wish I could tell my other friends and family, but I just feel like they would judge me. I've always been looked at and thought of as ""the happy one"". Being so positive, fun and optimistic. My life is pretty good compared to my other siblings, so I sometimes feel guilty and like I should be grateful.",severe
"Heart won't stop aching : This is the first time I've been truly open about my depression. Usually I'm able to manage it, but I think I've hit a new plateau and now my heart won't stop aching. It's been 3 days and the aching is unbearable. I might actually die from a broken heart, which is something I welcome. I've had a death wish for a long time now. 
I've had my depression since I was in High School. I grew up in an abusive home (physical and mental) and no matter how times DYFS, now called CPS (Child Protective Services), came for a home visit they never ""saw"" any abuse happening. I now own a copy of every report for when DYFS was called. It's 200 pages thick, not exaggerating. You think if they had printed the entire history they finally see something wasn't right. But, that's just a side rant about a broken system.
Since I grew up in a broken home I was a bit weird and didn't understand half the things I said or did were not normal. This led me to be ostracized by my peers and even by my teachers to the point that they would sit by and watch me be bullied because of the reputation of my parents. I once had a student jam a pencil into my head and I was sent home for self-defending myself against him. 
This caused me to be alone to my thoughts 24/7 because I couldn't express myself at home or outside. I had no friends, no family, and no support. This caused be to become severely depressed by the time I was 14. I didn't even cry anymore because I became accustomed to the pain of being alone and the abuse and thought it was normal. 
When I turned 18 I ran off with a man I became engaged to after only knowing him for a month. I realize now I was just trying to escape my life. I would end up enduring 6 months of mental torture from this man. He would lock me in the house with no way to contact anyone in the world. Tell me how beautiful I was, but then an hour later berate me for how hideous my body looked. He would secretly tell his friends what a terrible cook I was and how worried he was to leave his dog alone with me for fear I might kill it. Even though he would use a ""baby voice"" to ask me to cook for him or watch his dog. Some nights I had to sleep on the floor because he would be mad at me for something. But, my mental psyche didn't truly break till after he raped me and started withholding things in exchange for sexual favors. 
I was at a all time low with my depression and anxiety that I took a whole bottle of Tylenol and poured the contents into my hand ready to commit suicide. I stared at all the pills in my hand for what felt like an eternity. I raised the pills to my mouth and looked at myself in the mirror and started to ball my eyes out. I didn't commit suicide, but something did die that day inside of me. Looking at myself in the mirror getting ready to kill myself really put things into perspective to me. After an hour of crying on the bathroom floor I got up and escaped that night from my ex-fiance. 
It would take years after that for me to get my life on track. But, I managed to get 2 degrees, a decent job, friends, and a dog of my own. I went through a lot of healing from my past and reached a point in my life where I was a bit happier. I mean my anxiety and depression were very easy to trigger, but I was able to recognize my own toxic traits and manage my depression. 
Despite being the strong independent person, I still couldn't find love. That wholesome, intimate love. I'm now trapped in this generation of ghosting and insincere emotions. I'm trapped in this pattern of feeling like I connected with someone until they ghost me or tell me ""You're a great guy, but I just don't think we're romantically compatible"" or feel like I was used for sex. 
Then I did meet someone who I connected with very deeply. He was so sweet to me, very kind, compassionate, understanding. It really felt like this was gonna go somewhere meaningful and then out of the blue he tells me he has to end things because he's moving after matching in another state for work/his research. He said it was a difficult decision, but it didn't make sense to have a relationship if he was going to be moving. I would of been willing to move with him and now my heart won't stop hurting. I don't know how to respond to his messages anymore. I can't even cry it hurts too much. I haven't been able to sleep and my heart hasn't stopped aching. I honestly don't think it's going to stop.
Life has just been so painful to me, especially with love that I wish I could just die already. I've already become completely numb to ever being open to love or emotions so what's the point anymore? What's the point of healing from your past, if the present doesn't return the favor? I don't know what to do. I just want to stop hurting already. I might not even wake up tomorrow and I'm praying that will become true. I just can't do life anymore, it makes no sense to me. 
I've tried to be a good person, hoping one day I could reap the rewards and now my life is almost halfway over and still nothing. I don't even know why I'm writing this out, it's not making me feel better.
TL;DR: Grew up with depression due to abuse from home and school. Turned my life around after attempted suicide. Met someone who I fell deeply for and suddenly decides to break it off from me. Leaving me in a pit of depression with my life",severe
"Forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. Realizing this might just help me : Before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there  is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. But when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. As if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and discard the old busy life. As for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations  I've had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. I could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. ""You got some of them dark jokes"" ""somthing you probably can help me with etc"".   
I guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place.  
So when I'm depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago- Despite the self hatred and despair. In that way, it might just help me. I sound like a therapist talking to a depressed 13 yo, i know. But i sorta hope this is uplifting.  
But I wanna add the fact that I'm 18, and I've had depression 3 times in my life. And maybe I have yet to discover what real depression is, or haven't lived long enough to actually state this as matter of fact",severe

"How can I get out of depression, when I don't even know what 'normal' feels like after more than a decade of depression : I'm 20 yrs old and I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. Even when I was 6/7, I remember feeling the exact same feeling as when I'm deeply depressed. The sort of heaviness and pit in your stomach. Most of my family is estranged and I truly just have my dad. I know that if it weren't for him still being alive, I would have done it.
I truly don't think I've ever been not depressed. Today, I just had the realization that it's been 10 years of 'official' depression, aka when they diagnosed me. It hasn't been better. It's been worst,  and they pain of knowing it's been so long makes it far far worse.
So my question is: how can I get out of depression, when I don't even know what 'normal' feels like? Is that even possible.
I'm not suicidal, like I said, that thought of my dad hurting stops me. It's a genuine question. Has anyone ever been able to do so? How?",severe
"Drug use is the only thing that masks depression anymore. M 23 : I'm getting more and more fed up with medicine and psychiatry. I've taken Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Abilify, and Vraylar, not to mention off label propranolol. They always make me feel less depressed at first but it ALWAYS goes back to depression after a few weeks or months until I end up in the psych ward again (three times now).  The drugs do SOMETHING and have mild side effects but never lasting depression relief. I've been talked out of suicide in varying degrees of seriousness several times as well.
The only thing that does anything for depression, as temporary as it is, is abusing acid, ketamine, opiates, alcohol, etc. (in a cycle to mitigate tolerance and side effects). I don't even like using drugs every day and really prefer being sober and happy but the sober depression is always crushing. Idk what to do anymore but I'm always tempted to just OD on opiates and end it.

"I need some help and I didn't know where else to ask : Finally, tomorrow.
Yesterday was difficult. Almost from the moment I wake up, I had some sort of panic attack. I was having shortness of breath and felt uneasy throughout the day. I've done most of my coping techniques to calm down -- cleaned my room and the kitchen a little bit, went outside for some sun and fresh air, trimmed my beard that I've been thinking about doing for days, and whatnot -- to no avail. I try to counteract it by writing positive things on my journal. It didn't do much. Though, towards bedtime, I felt a little better, relaxed. At that point, I just wished that it'll not continue through the next day.
For several days now, and even weeks, I think I've done good. I've been asking myself ""healthy or not healthy?"" so I can calibrate my actions towards healthy throughout the day. It's quite effective, but not wholly. There is a time that I thought it would be healthy to go outside and have some sun. I did, but I also smoked a cigarette, and I might have a walk to the store to get some more later. I know, it's bad, but I'm kind of riding along with it. I feel like it's better to go out and walk to get some cigarettes than to stay indoors for the rest of the day and sulk. At this point, I just try to get out of the house more often, and sometimes I compromise to do just that. I just think that that's healthier.
The thing though  I feel that at some point, I wouldn't know if I'm becoming truly healthy or not. Maybe, at one point, my ""healthy"" is actually unhealthy and I wouldn't be able to tell. I think I'm ready to get professional help again. It's been a full year ever since I last spoke to a professional. I suddenly stopped going because I felt that it wasn't going anywhere, and I felt dismissed by my therapist. The latter may be subjective. Maybe I just can't move on from my ex, like she said, and not about coming back to the place where I was once I felt like myself. I asked her once if coming back to my homecountry was a good idea. I thought that was the last time and place that I felt like myself without all the heavy depression(relatively), that may be it'll make sense to go back. Yes my ex was there, but so was my friends, school (at that time), and me. She replied, ""you just miss your ex."" I couldn't said no because yes, I did. Then she continued on with god knows what because at that moment, I remember closing shut. Ever since, I haven't opened up to anyone and have been enduring this shit on my own.
And god be damned, my last year was my most difficult. Everyday, when I woke up, I am greeted by a slur of self-depreciation. I don't even get it. How is that my first thought of the day? How did it surpass ""I'm thirsty"" or ""I need to pee."" I have suppressed most of my thoughts of previous happiness, mostly with the aforementioned past life. I thought, ""those are not yours anymore and it's heinous to even think about it."" Consequently, I've lost all my contacts from that time. I'd like to celebrate me after I moved, but I just can't see anything to celebrate. I've kept a journal almost throughout the year. I wish I can say that I've progressed, but no. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I was the same. I stagnated for almost a year (not counting the past years, that I've done so as well). I find little to distract me from my misery. I tried to play games, do some chores, watch movies, etc, but the thought would just catch up. ""Nothing you do matters. All of it is only a farce."" I tried hard not to compare myself to others' progress, but whenever I do with my own, there's nothing. Everyday it's a little better, sometimes worse. I coasted. I convinced myself that that was me. I really do deserve hell for all what I've done, and to justify them, I'll need to kill myself.
It was difficult to think otherwise because for the one good thing that I have guilt-riddenly thought that I have or done, I have ten bad things to convince me that I deserve to stay in hell. It's still difficult to this moment. Now, I hope that there's a way for it not to be, or at the very least a little easier to be alive. I'm 28 now, a college dropout, no work experience, no savings, no friends, none anything. It's difficult to imagine that I'll be someone someday from this point of view, but I have hope. Finally, I can see myself past my depression.
I wish I could say that this is the end, but it's merely the beginning, and the most difficult. I've been contemplating for days now to ask help from my family, but I'm frightened with what they'll say. The last time I confided with my parents, they make it all about themselves. They told me that I had a difficult time is because I was far away from them. It may have contributed to the problem, but I can definitively say that they are not what makes me. I knew that I was having trouble. I have my internal contradictions, but it wasn't them. They just turned me off, but all I have now is them. I don't have anymore friends to confide with. Their lives are so far away from when we last interacted that I don't think they want to go back to a time when I was in their lives. I don't want to burden them anymore. God knows I have done enough to bring misery to their lives, and I'll hate myself if I added some more.
I have no other moves left. I have hope now, but I feel stuck on this part. I need some encouragement and humility to push through this next step, to get help. I thought maybe I can find it here. I didn't know where else to go. Please. I know I can do it, but I feel frightened and feel unable to.

I have Thyroxin, iron problems, a bad, painful exhausting shark week, sleep problems, allergys.
I feel exhausted nearly all the time and that makes my depression worse. I can't even consume alcohol or Coffein like i used to, it will trigger really bad feelings and a bad sleep with dreams.
It is like my overall thoughts, paranoia and bad behavior patterns arent enough. 
I already have to take 4 pills a day im not sure if Antidepressiva is a good idea with this combination. 
Anybody else with this problem?",severe
"I need to get this story off my chest : So... this is one of the horror stories of my life. A while ago I was very unhappy at my job and being fired from the previous one I didn't want to screw this one up too. I was already on Lexapro for MDD and Lorazepam for GAD. I was feeling so shitty, I just couldn't do my job... and I had a pack of Lorazepam. I took one, it didn't help like usual. Took 2, nothing. Before I knew it, I took much more... to this day I have no idea how many and why. I don't remember. I started to feel sick so I told my manager I need to go home. She said yes. I was working really close to home and back then I still lived with my parents cuz I couldn't afford to move somewhere else. As I was feeling very drowsy, I crossed the main intersection to my house and I collapsed before reaching the pavement. A guy saw me and ran to me. Again, I don't remember much but he told me he was a trained professional. Everything is such a blur. He started to walk me home and I manages to tell him where I live but afterwards I don't remember much. I remember just waking up in my bed surrounded by paramedics. They were injecting something in my arm. Then, I passed out again. 
I woke up in a blur, my mom told me the guy who brought me home told them that I must have taken something. My mom is a doctor and she called the ambulance. She was crying. I didn't realise what has happened. She also told me that the paramedics asked me how I could have been so irresponsible because I put my life in danger. Apparently I told them I didn't care about my life but I don't remember saying so. My mom asked if I had done it on purpose and to be honest I don't know. I guess initially not but when I was on many pills I really didn't care what would happen to me. And to this day it scares me that I've done this. Did I really value my life so little that I put it in danger for a shitty job which I hated with all my being?
I told my parents that it was a mistake but I honestly don't know if it was. However after a few days they forgot the incident or they didn't want to talk about it anymore. And to this day they don't believe that something is wrong with me. It's crazy. 
The point is when I think of this story I'm scared that I might really hurt myself one day. Especially at work because at work I am more depressed than I have ever been in my life. Anyone else? Thank you for reading.",severe

"I need your help.. please : Hello for anyone who cares.
I've just been diagnosed with depression after struggling for 2 years. I've attempted suicide before but clearly I'm still here. Anyway, as a 15 years old girl my parents (and psychiatrist) have me a choice: 
1. IP treatment, but my mom doesn't want it because I'll be disconnected from the outside world.
2. Decide to get better for myself and go see a psychologist. Thing is, I don't want to get better. I want to die. I know I'll attempt again at some point.

"Negative Lexapro Reaction : My psychiatrist recently prescribed me Lexapro. A few hours after taking it for the first time, I suffered a major panic attack while driving home from work. I was convinced I was having a heart attack based on my symptoms, which were chest pains/pressure on my abdomen, pins &amp; needles in my arms, difficulty breathing, cold sweats, and tunnel vision. I pulled over to call 911, and spent the night in the hospital.
I didn't know if this was because of the medication at first, so I continued taking it for a few days after, but I kept experiencing similar side effects. I decided to stop taking it until I spoke to my psychiatrist again. Has anyone here experienced anything similar with this medication?",severe

I was prescribed Wellbutrin to treat both ADHD and depression.

"should i go to the mental hospital ? :  i am a minor, my mom would be the one taking me so i dont want to waste anyones time, especially since she has a job. i was hospitalized 1 time in august of 2018 for 6 days, i got a therapist afterwards, i quit therapy in December 2018.  my therapist moved states so i can no longer see her.

"Alone in a hotel room in a strange city and really want to kill myself. : I'm not anticipating anyone will read this, I'm just hoping that by getting my thoughts out there I can help this atrocious feeling to pass.
The last few months have just been so awful.  I left an abusive marriage and got divorced and moved to a new state to be near my parents.  I got a new job, which I like but it's sucking the life out of me due to unreasonable demands and a grueling schedule and the feeling that I'm never doing enough.  I've gained 20-ish lbs back after losing 60 and just feel so fat and disgusting and ugly.  I cry every time I look in the mirror.  I've been sick with ongoing illnesses for about 7 months.  I can't sleep, I cry all the time, and constantly feel like I'm on the verge of a heart attack.
I'm doing all the ""right"" things.  Seeing a therapist, getting established with a new doctor, taking an antidepressant.  I just can't get through this.
Right now I'm a few hours from home, traveling for work and staying alone in a hotel.  I've tried texting my boyfriend throughout the day but he's busy.  I haven't said what's wrong, just trying to get some attention and connection to help, and I'm afraid if I tell him how bad I'm really feeling that he'll get scared off and I'll lose him.  He's really the only person I have in my life at the moment, besides my mom, who also just doesn't understand.

"What does ""getting better"" feel like? : Hi! I'm a 16 years old girl, so I'm still quite young and at a very confusing stage in my life. Having recently been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety doesn't really make it better I suppose. 
Now my mental health has been steadily going down since 5th grade/11 years old. I never even though i would turn 16, let alone get rid of my suicidal thoughts. So it did ""get better"", because I grew to no longer wanting to kill myself, becoming clean of self harm and actually becoming a person with a social life that I'm even a bit proud of. 
Still it's not. Good? My suicidial thoughts are gone but only because of the immense guilt they bring me, most of the time i wish i wouldn't have a family or friends just so that I could end it all. Life is hard. I don't have the motivation to do anything. I literally can't imagine a happy future for me or any future at all to be honest. 
I also have been getting SO much worse since a few months ago. Anxiety attacks have become way more frequent, my derealization symptoms have been acting up like crazy - going outside is overwhelming and makes me want to cry and hide. It's all just too much, I don't know how to handle it and now even the friendships I worked so hard for begin to crumble bc I can't be a good friend right now, especially to the friends that also suffer from mental illnesses. 
So, what does it feel like to ""get better""? How do you do it? Therapy hasn't worked so far, it seems to have made it worse even though my therapist is a wonderful and competent woman. How does it feel like when therapy ""works""? 
We're thinking of getting me on medication, what is that like? Is it scary? I am kind of scared. I tried denying that I'm mentally ill for so long, I guess I'm just hoping to hear of some experiences because I don't understand anything that is going on. 
Thank you if you read this lengthy text!! &lt;3

TL;DR: Recently got diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety, hoping to hear of some experiences with that and what ""getting better"" and the process of good therapy is like.

"Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you (27 M) : Alright guys kind new here, This might be a lengthy post so please bear with me. I developed depression anxiety at age 17 just one day I felt fatigued and didn’t wanna do anything I enjoyed anymore. The feeling never left after that. I was like that for two years without getting any kind of treatment but was still able to have a job and go to school and I was doing quite good. I finally decided to try and anti depressant (Zoloft) and it picked me right up. After some time it quit working and the depression came back not worse just the same. I went through every single anti depressant available after that and I landed on prestiq which also stopped working after some time and cymbalta after which also stopped working after some time. My psychiatrist then recommended abilify. I got on abilify in conjunction with cymbalta. It worked right away or so I thought. Made me feel super energetic and wanted to fit so many activities in one day. Eventually I realized that although I was happy, I was doing things I wouldn’t normally do ( spend money, sleep with a ton of women, get tattoos) this lasted 2 years. Then I said the hell with this I rather be depressed than deal with this. Came off the meds cymbalta and abilify and to my surprise the depression was gone after a month of tapering off, my psychiatrist mentioned that she had never seen a recovery like that. I went without meds for about 2 years. During this time everything came back to normal. I graduated from college (mechanical engineering) aced almost all my classes in 4 semesters except for one course (15/16) got a new job and was doing super well. My life got tough I have a 6 year old child and just keeping up with everything was impossible as I have no family. I got severely depressed again. I was really reluctant to go back on meds because I felt that the only thing that helped ( abilify) made me feel strange and made me do things I wouldn’t normally do which sounds soo ridiculous. Well I was losing my hair lol and was looking for things to help my situation and came across something called finasteride. Didn’t wanna take it but ended up doing it. I was already depressed and this thing amplified it times 100. Started getting strange suicidal imagery, crying spells, super sad all the time, then one time at the store I’m 100% sure I heard a voice in my head make a comment about my surroundings. This freaked me the fuck out because I was fully aware this happened in my mind. I went to the psychiatrist after that cuz I was sure I was losing it. This was the first time this had happened so I was so frightened. When I got to the psychiatrist I told him about everything expect the voice I heard that day. I was ashamed and he had a student with him (she was super hot haha) anyway he prescribed Effexor and abilify (5mg) and shit got better again. But I got the spending urges and wanting to go out and stuff. Brought this to my psychiatrist attention and switched the abilify to lamictal (100mg) and it worked at the start but I feel like it’s starting to wear off. My head hurts all the time, feel nausea all the time, depression is about the same not too bad, no suicidal thinking, ring in my ears and they feel clogged (tinnitus I think), after imagery when I close my eyes sometimes, feel like I’m hearing sounds but only when there’s people making noice around me and stuff like work or at home no voices or anything like that. I had something weird right now which I can describe as shutter vision where I think I saw a line of my tattoo twitch but I also flexed my arm so it could be that and I’m just freaking out right now. Has anybody here felt that when they started to develop schizophrenia? Please any advice will be super appreciated. I’m a 26 year old male, only been diagnosed with major depression up until now.i suggested to my psychiatrist about possibly being bipolar but didn’t think so. Life has been so rough lately as well. Sorry for the rant once again.
I posted the above thread about three months ago, since then I got a new job and started grad school. Recently, I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression again I’ve been working 100 hours every two weeks, two classes in grad school and my son as well. Has anyone here experienced anything similar to the above? My friend has told me that I am going through A LOT and just to relax. I’ve been thinking I’m bipolar but not sure as I’ve never gotten a manic episode or hypomanic as all I remember for the past year and a half is a being depressed and anxious. Really thinking of getting back on abilify but that’s really last resort as I don’t act like myself when I’m on it but it does lift the depression. Any advice from anyone as what I should do next ?",severe
"Don't know what to do, feel empty at night, just want to sleep : I've been trying my best to fight my depression, but it's getting hard to figure out the causes of it to actually prevent it. 
I was feeling fine most of the day, although around the afternoon I felt way out of it, like I was going to cry. I realized I hadn't had any kind of caffeine yet like I usually do, so when I got home around 4 I had a cup of coffee, and worked out (which I usually do in the morning). I felt OK for a couple of hours after but slowly started feeling crappy up to now (9 pm) I video chatted my friend and I could feel a sense of hopelessness coming on, to the point where I got off the call after only a few minutes and cried, partly because of how bad I was feeling, but also because I felt like a mess. 
I usually get sad at night, around 8, to the point where I don't want to do anything and just go to bed early, but this felt different. 
I'm on 20mgs of Lexapro, and 20mgs of Latuda. I'm also on Adderall Extended Release because I told my psych I felt like stimulants help my depressive symptoms go away, as well as help my concentration, which they seem like they both do.
My main problem is that I feel like my depression is getting worse, but also that I get depressed at night and don't want to play video games or anything like I used to, and really just want to sleep. Maybe it's my Adderall wearing off (I take it around 8 or 9 am) Maybe it's my environment (I've tried to switch up the furniture in my room to basically no effect) Maybe I'm just bored and overthinking it? But why would I cry?
Any advice would be appreciated, and I can provide any extra info if asked. I just wanna know where I should go from here, because I don't want to feel like this anymore, I want my motivation to do stuff back.",severe
"Out of options : Last week the person I thought was my best friend reported me to my college for being at risk of suicide. I got upset at him, he asked if we were still friends, and I said that I don't know because I feel like he broke my trust.
Since then, I realized that I was just hurt and took it out on him. I've tried to apologize multiple times but he won't reply. He blocked me on his finsta (I feel ridiculous writing that) so I'm not sure if I should just take it as a sign that things are over and I should give up. If he's gone, then there goes my entire friend group because they're all friends with him.
The first time I tried to get therapy I was told my life was too complicated and to go somewhere else. Last week I put in a request with my insurance to find providers in my area. It got returned by saying there's nobody available within 20 miles of my house. It was already going to be complicated to get treatment, but now I can't even if I wanted to. 
The only way I've even partially coped with this is by getting drunk and/or high whenever I can.

"Watching TV/Listening to music but 'blanking out' : I was too scared to bring this up to anyone IRL or online; let alone even a counselor - but has anyone else dealt with something similar to being under depressive episodes throughout most of your lives reclusive and watching/binging all sorts of TV and music - but without paying attention/taking it in on an emotional level?

I have had suicidal thoughts often, a period of about a year about 2 years ago I was self harming either by cutting or cutting off circulation in my hand with either a rope or my watch. I have never attempted suicide however.
I've had many tropes and basic personality traits I've been allocated. I've been called psychopathic casually by my friends and insultingly by completely unrelated people. But to my friends I'm also their make shift therapist or go to friend to talk to when they feel like shit. I have no idea what to say half the time and somehow everyone seems satisfied. I spend the whole situation trying to reason what they're saying and once they go thinking about it myself. 
I was severely bullied as a child just for being a cliché nerd and don't really trust people easily and always feel like im being watched.
I have had councelling before but after a few months I ended up stopping as I had no idea what to say so started lying as a cover up and eventually stopped going all together.

"My story and trying to seek for happyiness : Well, here i am who would have ever thought that i’m going to be depressed and anxious. Never would think i would end up here, i used to be a happy kid, didn’t cared much just enjoyed my life.
I created a new account, just to be on this subreddit, don’t want to that someone of my „friends“ might find out what is wrong with me. I seem like a normal guy to everyone, i’m just trying to be okay, but it’s not an easy ask. Everyone thinks it’s just something simple, why would be something yet so simple, so dangerously?
I was always kinda the weird guy, i never had much friends i rather enjoyed being alone. When i still was younger maybe 10years old, i always came home happily, turning on my console and just forget everything and enjoy life. I never concentrated on my real life, everything was stressy, i never made my homework, my parents screamed at me for not doing shit, just playing on my console. Whenever i had school, i didn’t even cared at all, i just tought about my console what i’m going to do next, because i never had much interest in life. I only had like two friends?
I actually went out everyday at some point, it was fun.
There was a game, that i really enjoyed playing. 
I met a lot of internet friends there, i always concentrated on the a internet because it was much easier to get friends.
When i was like 12yr old i searched for friends, because it was trendy to have much friends. So i still was a kid and wanted to get a girlfriend, so i’ve found an girlfriend through the internet, it never was serious but it still kinda affected me in a way. I always wanted to have a girlfriend. Everyone had a girlfriend except me. 
It wasn’t like that, my parents loved me. They gave me much love, i didn’t felt unloved something was just missing.
When i turned 13, i started „growing up“. I continued to play, but something felt different, my feelings changed. I started feeling kind of depressed, because i didn’t had a childhood like everyone else, i mostly was alone playing on my console and writing with my internet friends.
I was seeking for happyiness, so i tought i should get a girlfriend. I started randomly adding people, and there was one girl. Let’s call her Sun. This girl changed my whole life.
We started to write more and more, i felt happy for having her, it wasn’t real love at the beginning but i still felt happy. So, we were together for like a few months, until she broke up with me. I didn’t cared, because it wasn’t serious. Months later i wrote her, that i’m depressed and somehow we came together again.
This time things got more serious.
She lived like 800km away from me, but we still wanted to meet. ( I was 15 there) I kinda felt depressed, i don’t know why. I just had no feelings and i didn’t had much friends neither. 
I had some friends but they were toxic against me. I started cutting myself, it started to be some small cuts, until i began to cut more and deeply. Weeks later i started to cut my face, i still don’t know why i cut my face, maybe i wanted attention so someone might help me?
The school saw me. They spoke with me, why do i cut myself? i told them i had no sense in life, i’m lonely no one wants me. The whole school is just against me. So i started to get some help from the school, i didn’t helped much. But i stopped cutting myself so i don’t need to talk with them ever again.
It was rather an easy task to stop cutting. Months later, i continued writing with my girlfriend i kinda stopped loving her, but we arranged a meeting at my home. I kind of didn’t cared.
Two days before we would meet i felt extremely happy. When she was there, i smiled the whole time and felt happy, i never smiled in my life before, i rarely smile. I just don’t like it.
We were both happy, i never was so happy before like i was with her. We met every vacation  and i was super happy with her.
But there was one problem that always followed me. I had extreme trust issues i always tought she didn’t love me enough, i’m not good enough i tought she is just going to fall in love with another one.
Months later, we met again this time, everything felt good just positive feelings. I was happy with her. Things continued to be good with her for like 2 weeks. But when she came back home, everything was weird, she stopped loving me and.. She just broke up with me, i never felt so much pain before.
I stayed the whole night awake, afraid of myself that i might end up my life.
Things continued like that for 1year. I slept the whole day, because i didn’t want to feel being alive.
This is where the true story starts.
After some time, i kind of recovered, i turned 16 but i was seeking again for happyiness, i tought of getting a girlfriend, but i said myself i don’t want anyone except my ex, i also felt unloved. No one liked me.
So i found a drug, called MDMA. 
I was happy to try it out, giving me the positive feelings i’ve had with my ex.
I contacted a friend of me, we used to be good friends, we kinda had the same interests, so we met, i told her i want to take mdma with her. She told me she wants to try it out too.
I didn’t informed me much about the drug, so i just took one pill. Didn’t feel anything after 2 hours i dropped 2. I had over 600+ mg mdma inside my bloodstream now.
Suddenly i started feeling something, i was so happy but minutes later, i felt apart. Because i took to much, i panicked and fell on the floor, it was winter and i was laying outdoor in the freezing cold temperatures. Someone called the ambulance, they picked me up. I tried to talk with them if iam okay they told me, im pretty lucky that i survived.
I don’t know why, but i gave them the number of my parents, so they called them and they visited me. It’s still hard to talk about this, because it left a deep scar in me.
They saw me, on drugs and i never felt so bad before.
They got me home and talked with me, i told them these things that i feel unhappy and i just needed something.
Weeks later, i felt good? Because i was glad i survived and i was happy. Months later the same shit happend, i felt unhappy and cold. 
I had some friends that used to get high a lot, so i asked them if i could join them.
I really liked the feeling, of being high, it kinda made me happy. So i continued doing it for months and months, I was high everyday, after school i came back instantly to my friends just to get high, i wasted all my money on this. (I was 17.) 
There was one day, i was so high that i had a tought loop and, it just didn’t stop. Few minutes later, it ended and i felt better. But when i got home i felt extremely anxious. 
I had severe anxiety for months, i still have it. I couldn’t go to school, the only thing i could do is sitting at home and doing nothing.
It got better, but i really started to feel depressed. The feelings i’ve had when i was younger, it just was some sadness. But now something definetly was wrong with me.
Because i still didn’t recovered and i used drugs to hide the scars, it only made it worse.
I started a therapy, it lasted like a few months. I got kicked out because i barely walker and she tought i was okay, i’m just sad because of my ex.
Now i’m here, i’m anxious depressed and i’m afraid of the future. I don’t know what else i have left to say, my mind is completely broken. I just felt like writing a short story of my life.
Thanks.",severe
"I’m a Soft Machine; a Vent and a Wish. : I want to get everything off my chest, I’m not concerned with the length of this as much as I want to just spill it all like a God fearing man in a confessional. The years of depression and anxiety has made me fickle. I’m really not a mean person; just emotionally inept as of late. When the passion you had gets drained, it’s hard to find a reason to care about what you say or even continue. So if I say something that seems rude or extreme, I’m sorry. Although I’m sure most of you can relate to me on this one. To start, I’m 18 I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and Panic Disorder. They are mostly related to one another and just perpetuate when one flares up. I’m so tired, I’m so unhappy, and the moments where I feel happy are fleeting and don’t remain long. I’m struggling more and more to pick myself back up and reclaim my former self. It doesn’t much help that when you get prescribed the Pandora’s box that is SSRI’s, people see you different. Not negatively, just different; a house made of egg shells. Something that could crumble with a glance, and it’s not entirely incorrect. So you hide it, because you don’t want people to care. You hate to be responsible, hate that they’re watching with pressure, hate to be called by your parents because it reminds you of when you were young. Reminds you of what it’s like to be you again; seems so long ago. SSRIs remove the flavor of life, emotions. And no matter how much spice you give, you still can’t taste it. It’s a float, it’s a delay. It’s a way to postpone your flavor until your brain decides to let you have them back. But even prescriptions upon closer inspection reveal a unbecoming truth. The truth that we aren’t as in control as we wish we could be. Our thoughts are a hop, skip and a small oval green pill from being nothing more then a scribble in the sand. But despite the odds, I’m still moving. I’m still here. I won’t let my existentialism bring me down more then it has. I wish for one day where I’m happy again, and I wish the best for all of you! Thank you for reading my twice told tale of teenage woe lol.",severe
"Dropped out today : I dropped out of nursing school today. Worked harder than I ever have for years and then realized in the final stretch I couldn’t do it anymore. Feeling pretty shit about it. Decided to post in a nursing sub for possible support. Quickly became aware I wasn’t welcome there. So now I’m here. 
I’ve struggled with chronic PTSD and depression since I was 14 years old. I don’t have a family to reassure me everything’s going to be okay so I’m just feeling kind of lost. I thought I had it figured out. Now I don’t know where to go from here. 
Feeling pretty hopeless. Sorry if this post doesn’t make any sense.",severe
"Cant open up anymore. : My girlfriend left me for my depression and my stupid problems so now I keep it all inside too scared to loose any of my friends.
 I was told that im too intense and now all I can do when im close to ending it all is to numb myself away with drugs. 
I feel ugly, weird and most of all alone. 
I dont want to hurt anyone, I just dont want to fight this depression on my own.",severe
"My little brother may have cancer and I think meds are causing me to feel strongly about suicide : Hi all, 
I found out today that my little brother may have lymphoma and he is being tested for it. I’m an absolute mess right now. I just started Valdoxan last night and have not wanted to die more than now. Not sure if it’s a meds thing but holy shit. The world is absolutely fucking bleak. I would give my life and more just so my brother could live. He doesn’t deserve this and I can’t fucking handle it. I don’t want to see him in pain or hurt. He has so much potential and he’s so kind and just such a gentle presence in the world. I just can’t handle this but I would so gladly give him my place in life. 
I’m also sick with the flu and missing work and feeling like I’m out of my body all together and I started Valdoxan last night. My mind is just somewhere else all together but I’ve never felt shittier. I’ve always thought about suicide but now the world just feels colourless and like I’m the outlier. I don’t even think I’m living. 
Is this normal? Do you think it could be because of the meds? Can they kick in this quick? I want to see my GP but he’s booked for 3 weeks. 
I’m sorry I just needed to let this out. Thank you for reading.",severe
"I cut myself today. : I cut myself while in the shower today. I did maybe 7 long cuts on my wrist. I get that that may seem like a low number but I'm really sensitive to pain so I was actually on the verge of passing out on the last cut. Everyone I've told is absolutely pissed. My girlfriend and I had a rule where if one person cuts, the other is allowed to. Normally it keeps us both from cutting but recently she's been in a hellhole and she needed relief. I tried to stop her, I really did, but she insisted that she would do it even if it ruined the promise. My girlfriend also wanted some space recently, so she hasn't been available to help. I also recently just left the group of friends I had been in due to toxicity and mistreatment of mental health issues. I only have one person so far who has provided genuine support.",severe
"Started Anti-depressants : Hello, 29f here. I have had anxiety and depression since a child. It's gotten really bad though lately and have been feeling suicidal (not going to act on it, I cant) but I knew it was time to seek help. I took my first dose of antidepressants apo-trazodone 50. Is anyone familiar with this drug. Did it help? Pros cons? Side effects. What is your experience with it? I do know what helps one person may not for another, just curious.",severe
"30 days to decide- Days 1-5 : I preface this by I am suicidal I decided to channel this constant feeling into words everyday and better understand what's pushing me into my constant spiral. For the last five days, I would write for an hour or so, including things I read or old poems that I revised and random ideas that popped into my head. I'm going to do this for 25 more days and decide on my course of action.
Day 1:
Lately there is this 10-15 second window between the vividness of a random dream and the emergence of my memories and ego. In that window of time, I feel a light sense of ease then I once again remember this is me and I'm still alive and then I begin my day.
I sit still in bed for an hour or after a bundle of random thoughts I eventually muster the courage to leave my room, I scan the hall in the hopes that my roommates are gone, I absolutely despise small talk and I sneak into the bathroom to freshen up.
If I don't feel too depressed I will get ready to go to class and while it is sometimes engaging I make the mistake of going too late and I have to sit next to someone. Today was such a day, I was 2 minutes late and I had to sit next to some blonde girl and it was at the center of the class room where I was surrounded entirely by conversation.
I try not to listen in but ADHD makes it impossible to not hear people when they speak. Some girls were talking about their shitty roommates, some guys were talking about getting laid, and another group was talking about tests and stuff. At one point in class we were talking about the first wave of migration in 500 AD in europe.
Some kid raises his hand and asks what they called the USA during this time period. Last semester, I was in a writing class where everyone hated on a style of writing because it was on instagram.
I see a common theme in life of blatant stupidity, rampant egotism, hypocrisy on every level, social hierarchy, and the thought of living like this perpetually into my fifties or sixties makes me want to drop out of society.
Yet that in itself is just another game of society, so I consider suicide the only rational option. I can't imagine anything making me happy when I am so bored I can barely handle it day by day.
I just remembered this funny little moment today, I was walking with my headphones in and I started daydreaming. I was at the top of a bridge, a bunch of cars are zooming past me and a cool breeze passes through my hair. I raise my arms to the side and dive off the bridge.
The summer sun gleans in the sky and reflects over the river and my body drops faster and faster as my ears pop. All I can hear is the sound of my body crashing and fading to dark.
Somehow that little dream had me smiling like an idiot and as I was opening this door I locked eyes with a girl and she smiled back. I always wondered why people walk around with smiles plastered on their faces. Do people smile because they are imagining their deaths? That thought makes me laugh…
Day 2:
I've been thinking maybe I should focus less on my struggles and more on anecdotes, poetry, and funny moments to form this memoir.
To commemorate all the lives that have wasted away in their thoughts. I was really curious as to what other people thought of death yesterday and I found a really interesting answer on reddit.
""All sensation stops. But all those memories and cognitions still exist. Without sensory input, the mind grasps at the only things it has: memory and logic. Where was I? Oh right, I was dying.
Again, no sensory input.
So it keeps grasping at that one straw. It keeps remembering. As far back as it can. It fills in the gaps with logic. You don't remember your birth, but you know you were born. So it fills it in.
And then there's nothing left. The VCR tape has been rewound... so it goes back again. You live your life. Again. Exactly as it happened. And then you die. Again. And you go backwards. Again.
The mind keeps going over this single timeline, this single experience, wearing a groove over and over again until things start to feel... familiar. Overly familiar.
It feels like you've been there before. Like you've had that conversation before. Like you've seen that person before. But... no, that's not possible.
But eventually, it's obviously possible. Eventually, you can hear that voice in your head that's a passive observer to your own personal hell. It's questioning your decisions. It's wondering why you're choosing to not better yourself.
It's warning you against bad decisions. How long will it take to start to listen to that voice? Who knows.
At some point, you forget that this was all by design. This is just how the world is. Those other creatures and people aren't me, they're just logical inserts, extensions of the subtle passing faces from that original reality. But what was that original reality? Who was he or she?
The separation from the original source makes you feel depressed. You figure there's no sense in trying to live up to your potential. This is all there is. Nothing happens afterwards. 
And then you die. All sensation stops. But all those memories and cognitions still exist..."" -JimeDorje
I experienced this feeling my entire life and I lived a life in my thoughts. Thinking and rethinking every moment and now I wonder why I persist. That will be all for today.
Day 3:
I tried to read an old book I used to work on and I couldn't recognize the person who wrote that book, the writing style, the content, the thoughts, nothing felt familiar.
It was like I was reading someone else's thoughts, yet I know I wrote it. I started to wonder who am I for everything to change and nothing about me to remain the same.
I realize this over and over again that the only thing that has ever stayed the same in my life is that I am deeply unhappy. It's not because of my life or trauma or anything, it's literally because my brain is broken.
Antidepressants don't work on me and I use ketamine recreationally to cope temporarily. The effects are so minimal that I have to admit it, my depression is my personality.
My shallow well of despair controls my entire life and leads me along. Now that my depression has returned all those old thoughts look awfully familiar here's an old passage I wrote.
All people are fundamentally the same:
I've found it increasingly that the things I thought I was missing out on are nothing special.
The people, their lived experiences, their actions, thoughts, and feelings are all the same.
There is no new dimension or added experience to care about. People are so breathtakingly simple, their flaws, their quirks, their obsessions are so easily displayed.
I struggle to not show my contempt at their nature yet what else could I say?
Idealizing Self Isolation:
I idealize my social isolation, I'm so used to being alone that whenever the opportunity comes up to not be alone I decide against it because I am better off alone.
I've been alone for the brunt of my life and I expect to be alone for the rest of it. I feel strength in that because I always have myself and I am never uncertain about that but around people that changes.
There's talking behind your back, snide comments, bullying, aggression, and overall selfishness. Being around people is and has never been rewarding to me, it's always fraught with insecurity and unhappiness.
My loneliness is a strength I use to define myself from other people, everyone else needs love, companionship, and friendship and all I ever needed was myself.
This is a part of me to the point where if I do start dating like I am right now or make friends I have distinct understanding that they are transient and when I feel like I need to get away I will disappear.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
These were thoughts I had while I had a partner and got more and more friends. Now I have none and no friends, by design and motivated by a very bad set of experiences that are irrelevant.
I am even more isolated and strangely more secure about my disinterest in other people. I have even stronger disinterest in life day by day things pass and the end grows ever so near.
Day 4:
I’ve been thinking about my legacy and not as if I would have impact, more as in what lack of impact would I have. As a highly isolated person I don’t expect anyone to mourn me, I’m not even expecting a facebook post. 
Although there is an off chance there would be some faux authentic posts and maybe a few people that knew me would be a little surprised. My only issue is what would happen to my car, cash, and possibly my hidden drug stash. 
I should probably come up with a plan for my possessions, but at the same time why would I care about that from the other shore? Death is a really handy solution to all your life’s problems because without life there are no problems. 
Ever heard the quote, the opposite of love isn’t hate it's indifference? Love and hate are two sides of the same coin, and there’s the love of life and the hatred of life. 
I am on the second camp, I hate life and I want to transition to indifference to life but as long as I am alive I cannot be indifferent to being alive.
Believe me I have tried my hardest to not care but it’s kinda hard to persist on a tightrope of giving and not giving a shit simultaneously. No matter how deep you hide your desires, no matter how much you reject the notion of happiness, no matter how much you close your eyes to all the happy people around you. 
You will forever hold the notion that, that could be possible for you. That one day it will all be okay even though it has never been okay and the only constant in your pathetic existence has been crippling anxiety and depression. 
Hope is my enemy as hopeless as I am I remain hopeful, hopeful about death and even hopeful about life. I am hopeful about everything and hopeless about existing. This is so turbulent and annoying that I can’t stand it and even the thought of sharing this makes me more confused about what in the hell I want.
I hate feeling like I was born with a prison sentence, I persist out of obligation and I desperately want to desist in existing in such a pointless discriminatory and hopeless world filled with an endless stream of insults and assholes that want nothing but the worst for me. I am so tired of fighting for no reason. 
Is what I would say if I really felt like that, my real legacy is nothing because death eliminates all your grudges and warmth. That’s it for today.  
Day 5:
My mom calls me everyday, she’s in another country and she checks in with me. My sisters talk to me and say hi, and I’ll admit the guilt gets to me a little. Then I remember if I am ever honest to my mother about my identity that she will disown and probably wish death upon me. 
I am contemplating whether or not I should tell her now so I could get that extra kick to push me over the edge. I remember last time I got a kick like that, my partner at the time acted like such a complete asshole and then acted like he had some moral high ground. 
I hated it so much I couldn’t stand his hypocritical behavior so I broke up with him and stopped interacting with other people. Especially people who were a part of his friend group, but enough of that I wanted to present the other side of my kill myself argument. 
I have a really nice therapist, they helped me a little and made me laugh in therapy. I am awkward like always so I fail to be friendly back but I tend to feel okayish at therapy. I have some friends who reach out occasionally. I have an old roommate who still talks to me. 
I have an old friend who checks in with me sometimes, a few people say hi to me. I don’t know all that absolutely fills my life with joy. 
I’m going to a group meeting tomorrow, I’m not sure how I’ll do. Admittedly I know I’ll do terribly and be an awkward silent mess until I slowly escape from the group like usual.   
That’s the weirdo that I am, I think I’d make a good case study for overly neurotic anxious and depressed piece of shit who has no real insight but is able to confidently state through ego that she knows everything.
I’ve had warm moments in life I just can’t remember them right now, is that because of my mental illness? That is so interesting, sometimes I can feel warm emotions and I can remember good moments but right now those don’t seem to exist. This has been a chronic problem or maybe its a personality trait.
All I know is any narrative of self improvement or feeling better, or feeling happy never lasts eventually I see right through my own facade and remember that I fucking suck. Here’s an old poem I wrote when the ketamine was working.
[Living as a choice](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/3711178/living-as-a-choice/)
I am shocked by the serenity surrounding me
Finding closure was no longer a fantasy
The calm that stills the sentient ripples of consciousness
The departure of lonesome thoughts and inebriation
A hole in my chest that could not be put to rest
Yet it all faded away in a moment, a calming respite
When the knot in my chest was at its least
The fence finally undone
Tears I've wanted to shed finally run
With the noose on my neck
Loose around my chest
I can finally lay to rest 
This morbid festival of pain
I want to live but not for another's design 
But for my own will and worth
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Shocking that someone so sad could write something not depressing and yet none of those words look familiar to me, as if written by a stranger. This seems more my tune:
What’s there to say?
The further I go the less I believe
What's with the need, for me to deceive
No one even cares about all my screams
I don't even care enough to believe
NOW!
I could sing a song
And you should sing a long
Come on let it out, don’t try to be strong
After all they’re just going to hear it wrong
What did they tell you?
That home is where the heart is?
Life gets better if you give it a chance?
But what if misery has made its place
Laying its laurels to rest in our space
Everywhere you go 
IT follows
Beating that drum
Flowing in your blood
That’s the siren’s song   
Of misery’s embrace
So sing along you dumb asshole
It’s okay I’m fucking disgrace too
So fuck this shit I’m out",severe
"My mental health is collapsing : Last year I was happy, and gained a lot of confidence and my mental health was really good overall. But for some reason It's getting bad again, I get anxious and paranoid extremely easily, I have no confidence anymore, and I feel like I'm a horrible person.

"In need of help for the future. : Hello everyone, I am fairly new to Reddit and I have never done anything like this before, so it's kinda scary, but I just need a boost. I am currently in my final semester of high school which means my life as an adult is about to begin. For most people this would be an exciting time and would be a cause to celebrate and get motivated, but I have absolutely no motivation left in me. I've been stuck in a bit of a hole for a very long time now. Getting on my feet seems impossible from where I currently stand. I have no vehicle, money, or job which makes college seem so distant and impossible; I want to teach English one day. In my current situation I'm unable to get help with my depression from a doctor and I don't want to burden down the only person in my family who knows about my depression diagnosis I received last year. These four years of high school have been a roller coaster ride and have drained me completely. I started high school with more motivation than ever, but after a while I became scared to even go to school and was frustrated at the thought of it. The friend group I've been a part of since my second year of high school has been torn apart and I continue to feel like I have no one around me to help. It's so scary having negative thoughts and feelings that you know are wrong but not being able to shake them. Finding the motivation to get out if bed in the morning is like looking for a needle in a hay stack.",severe
"This month broke me : Last week I started cutting again, bought a new knife cause a friend has my main one. I just got home from spending time with my best friend, but made things horribly awkward the last two days. And Wednesday marks two years since my grandmother died. I'm waiting for Sunday to end it. Say some final goodbyes. Drinking heavy tonight and working all day tomorrow. Let's compound the issue.",severe
"Spending my first birthday alone : I never thought I'd post here but I think I need to get something off my chest. I've been depressed for 6 years now and social anxiety followed, and I haven't told anyone about it. I feel lonely all the time and sad because of it, spending a lot of time sleeping. Trying to find a job is hard, and getting denied nearly every time is crushing as well. Never had a lot of friends growing up, still the case now. I just felt like getting a little something of my chest even if it was just something small. At least I made it this far along, never thought I would a couple years ago.",severe
"Im so alone : I dropped out of highschool during freshman year for many reasons and since then I have only talked to 2 people in the past 3 years. Every time I hang out with these people I call friends, all they do is lecture me like they are my therapist. I just want to hang out with my friends like a normal teenager. Every conversation is about me and my mental health and my future. I know their intentions are good and that they want the best for me but some reason I just ca't stand it. It makes me feel even worse. The fact that my mental health and my future is even a subject just annoys me. Its like they study me like im an animal at the zoo or something. Ive tried to make new friends but im so fucking awkward that I cant even hold a conversation with people for more than a minute. Ive also never had a girlfriend or just somebody to hug and feel happy with. Ive never felt so alone in my life.",severe
"Anyone feel their reason/rationality slipping? : This is hard to describe, but I feel like the depression is overall getting worse because I'm less able to distinguish between ""my voice"" and ""the depression voice."" 
It wasn't long ago that I would get negative thoughts (my friends tolerate me, I'll never reach this goal, etc) and be able to take a second and go ok, this isn't me talking, it's the depression. Like I could point out an irrational belief to myself. 
Now I'm not sure if my thoughts are rational or not, like the ""depressed me"" and ""me"" have merged. I genuinely don't know if it's irrational to think that I'll never be in a relationship, thinking that some suicides can be considered rational vs the result of a sick brain, or thinking that my depression will only get worse. 
I thought I would always have reason (barring something like dementia), but even that is questionable at this point and it's scary as hell.",severe
Today i picked a date. : I made sure it was enough time away for me to finish everything i want to do. But also a bit before graduation so that I dont ruin it for the few people that do care. I just cant do it anymore. day after day of waiting for it to end. watching the clock only for time to take me somewhere else to be miserable. tomorrow is my birthday and i dont care anymore. im gonna be 18. it means nothing but more responsibility and frankly life cant get any better with that.,severe
i self harmed : i’ve been doing it for the past couple weeks. i have such a low pain tolerance so all i use is scissors. never enough to actually kill myself but enough to hurt. i guess i do it because it helps me cope with my depression but i just realized now how terrible what i’ve been doing is. this is the only place i can share and get this secret off my chest.,severe
"Too much pressure : I’ve had depression since my early teens I’ve only recently started to some what cope with it, but it’s starting to get worse due to feeling so much pressure for me. I’m not gonna get too in depth but I basically have to get my shit together and not only take care of my self but also my mother. It’s seems so hopeless tho, every time I think about it it feels like I’m never gonna have enough to provide for myself and my family. I’m looking to learn to program but even then I feel like I’ll never have enough to not only make sure I get the help I need but also get my family help.",severe
"Not sure who else needs this, but you've made it through another day of existing. : I know how hard it is to be here sometimes, especially when the medicines that you're supposed to use aren't helping as much as you'd like them to, or the people around you don't seem to know how much you're struggling internally.
If you've made it this far into your day, though, or even if it's the middle of the night, and you just hopped online to scroll through Reddit, I just want to congratulate you. No matter what happened today, good job getting through it. I'm proud of everyone here. :)",severe
"Hey : I’m really sad and I don’t have anyone to talk to and I don’t know what to say but my chest hurts so much  and I really can’t stop thinking about killing myself  but I don’t want to hurt my family I really want to though ..I take medication and I really want to swallow everything I have.

"Trying alcohol for first time on Wellbutrin? : Honestly, I’m really sick of not being able to try alcohol. I want to have a drink or two, but I’m scared of what might happen. I have a group of friends that obviously will be looking after me but still. I’m on 300 mg a day. And I really don’t plan on drinking weekly or anything maybe a drink or two once a month. Any word of advice?",severe
"Nothing feels like it will ever get better, it only seems to get worse. : Just posting here because I really don't know where else to post. I feel like there's no one else to talk to or the  people I do talk to haven't been making me feel any better. Not a fault with them I guess an issue with me at this point.
I feel like my depression is getting worse and I don't know what to do about it. I don't get any sleep lately, I barely sleep 4 hours a day at that and I'm up all night. I have been avoiding sleeping because every time I go to sleep I have constant nightmares. There are no good dreams or normal dreams just constant nightmares of me killing myself, my dad being killed or injured, my mother and sister trying to kill me or some other harm and no one coming to help me. I wake up with anxiety and go to sleep with anxiety. I have nothing that distracts me or makes me feel less stressed anymore. I feel alone and angry and upset. I've been fighting with my abusive mother lately which is making me feel worse than I already feel. I think she's a major contributing factor to my mental health decline but I guess there are other issues not limited to it running in her side of her family unfortunately for me I seem to have inherited mental issues my grandfather started having in his youth and so did my mother. My entire family is prone to mental health problems except my father who's family has none.  
I have dreams that bother me lately and I don't really tell anyone about them because I'm worried what they'll think of me. In some of my dreams where my sister or mother is trying to harm or kill me I sometimes harm or kill them while telling them what I feel about them and how they hurt me. I don't like having these dreams because I feel glee and relief when I'm telling them how I feel or harming them in these dreams. Granted they all seem 'self defense' in these dreams but I don't like the feeling of happiness I get in these dreams. The feeling doesn't last when I wake up but I don't like having these dreams. I know I'm not a violent person and despite them abusing me I'd never hurt them IRL but I don't like being left alone with my thoughts and no distractions. It makes me feel like a monster. My friends I have told said these are normal kind of dreams for abused people but it doesn't make me feel any less disgusted when I wake up.  
For the last few days my depression has gotten worse. I don't feel anything anymore. Nothing makes me happy and nothing makes me have any feeling. I think I am completely desensitized to violent movies or similar stuff. Nothing makes me feel anything anymore. Crying, which I alternate between doing too much and not being able too makes me feel no relief.  
I've been an artistic since I was 9 and art ties into my mental health and if I can't or aren't drawing then I'm not happy. I haven't been drawing. This is both because I haven't because of depression and because I can't because my old pc cannot run a version of Photoshop I have I used for years. I want to use this old version of Photoshop because its sort of my depression comfort zone, so assholes telling me to just 'man up and change programs' aren't going to understand. My issue? I need a new computer. Issue there? no money. I don't have 300$ for the PC I need right now and I''m unemployed and my only source of income is drawing disgusting furry porn on furaffinity I fucking hate and barely get paid anything when I do. I haven't got paid in months and I don't know how long I can 'keep hoping' I'll get money to get my computer so that I can draw again like I used too. I feel like there is no hope that anything with change. The computer and the art are only part of my problems but I think I'd have less issues if I had some kind of outlet for my depression. Honestly the only reason I haven't killed myself at this point is because I am far too unmotivated to actually do it. Weather this is a good thing or not I don't know, who would even miss me? I'm a useless meat sack with no value to anything.  
I have crippling medical anxiety as well and literally anything that even remotely cause me harm or pain makes me have a uncontrollable anxiety attack. Have a chest ache probably caused from stress or too much caffeine? probably having a heart attack and dying, time to panic and no one will make me feel otherwise. Been to the hospital over 10 times for shit like this.  
Worst of all lartely when I have these panic attacks I hope they are actually what I think they are so they'd kill me. They have not yet.:/ Being terrified of dying and wanting to die at the same time is such a strange feeling.  
I have no outlets for my depression and feel nothing anymore. I feel like I'll never draw again and I'll never feel happiness. I'm tired of nightmares. I don't sleep anymore. I prefer the nightmares where Ted Bundy is strangling me while violating me, they're somehow less terrifying and make me feel less anxiety than the ones where my mother is killing me. I am jumpy and paranoid because of my lack of sleep and nnightmares. I cannot seem to relax. To make things worse my 12yr old dog is getting older. We all know what happens when animals get old. We lost two old pets I had since I was 10 last year  a few months apart, who my mom claimed was my fault because I wasn't there for one of them because we didn't know she was going to hae a seizure and die and the other I ""didn't love"" because I had a asthma attack from pet hair in the vets office and almost fainted and broke out in red lumps.  
But my fault and I don't love them I guess.  
Thanks for reading if you did, I just wanted to get thoughts out of my head for a while.",severe
help : my brain has convinced me that nobody cares. I’m so close to ending it all I’m so scared. I think about dying so much. I isolated myself from all my friends and family and every time I try to speak to them I get paranoid and I have a panic attack and I can’t do this anymore. Im so lonely and I don’t know what to do. I’m at my limit. I want to be happy and I want to accept that they don’t hate me and they’re not using me for their own gain.,severe
"The happiness mask : howdy everyone!
I wanted to touch on an interesting subject for me.
First of all I am an 11th grader and I have been suffering from severe depression and ocd/anxiety since the 8th grade...and yes I go to a psychiatrist I haven't diagnosed myself on my own.
I take 3 kinds of meds with relatively high doses, but I don't want to discuss that I want to talk about something else!
My life isn't the brightest in the first place, but it got worse a month ago. My father passed away at the age of 63...and he was a cancer patient.
From all the horrible experiences in my life so far I still believe I haven't seen anything yet. Let alone the dark and suicidal thoughts that I have from my depression. 
So my question is...I Am turning into such a happy and optimistic person and all this suffering has turned me into a much more mature person. I like to think I am more mature than most teens at my age.
Someone told me that people like to give what they don't have. Like if I don't have a happy life, it would make me much happier if I made someone Happy.
And it wasn't till recently that I found out that it's true!
So it's not like I am pretending to be happy in front of people. It's not a happiness mask it's just that I love being positive to people because that makes ME positive as well!
So don't think of your depression as a handicap think of it as a way to get more mature and experience life.
Plus a successful person with depression is way stronger than a successful one without something dragging them down!
So stay strong and keep fighting guys I know how it is to feel lost, lonely, not knowing who you are, not knowing if you're worth it, not knowing if anyone loves you. But in the end you should matter to yourself. I know you might hate yourself but you have to love yourself and care for yourself. Your mental health is important and don't feel hesitant to ask for help, especially professional help!
These are just some thoughts that have been roaming my mind lately!
Please tell me your opinion on this subject and I hope I brightened up your day and you're definitely not alone in this world. Take it from a depression patient.
Anyways I hope you have a wonderful day!
PS I forgot to mention that you're never gonna be always happy but you should keep fighting for happiness",severe
"anyone’s comments are help, you guys are the best help : if anyone could help i feel it’s you
i don’t really like talking about this in person at all, in fact it’s so much easier just talking right behind a screen for me as sad as it sounds but in reality it’s crazy because no one would ever think that with the outgoing personality that i’m lucky to have somehow.
I have adhd I’ve been through almost all of the pills, Concerta, Adderall, Intuniv, Strattera, Focalin, and currently I’m trying Vyvanse (Lowest Dose) again since the first time in 6th grade (I’m 18 now) hoping to see maybe a difference in the pill to help me focus, relax and sit still. But with all this stimulants I notice the same thing, yeah my focus goes up but it’s a constant anxious feeling within me. With non-stimulants I find myself to be really tired or burnt out and just more emotionally sad and I feel it makes my mild depression a little worse. I have to constantly be alone or leave groups of people just so I can have the time to bring me self back down again. My hands have been sweaty for as long as I can remember due to this nervousness. And i’m just looking for someone with advice, little tricks and tips to calm down. Just ways to cope with this nervousness and help me with my ADHD. (rp)

"I, (18M) feel guilty of existing : I don't know why, but sometimes i do things i don't really want to just to hate myself later, it's too much complicated to understand my own feelings. My mind is just a mess. I feel bad for my parents having a kid like this...
I think I have gotten used to hate myself and to give myself random ""motives"" to make this something that happens in a daily basis, I never know what I will feel tomorrow and it scares me, so it's easier to think that I will be hating myself tomorrow too. There's some days that i wake up feeling like I can do whatever I want to do, and thinking I can overcome my depression, y'know? I feel like I can try to do somethings to improve myself as a human being, and in the next couple hours I feel like the only thing to do is ending my life, the sooner the better. 
I don't have real friends or SO, my social life is empty, my life is empty, I can't feel nothing good, I can't connect with people, I'm trapped with me inside my mind, that's just fucked up and sad.

"We are adults. : My forearm stings. 
My arm with the scars from the times I was too drunk to behave like a normal person, when I acted out at my friends graduation party night and her sister had to drive around looking for me. The same night we celebrated our graduation, except, I wasnt graduating. Suffice to say, I was upset. I punched a kid. 
I've been upset my entire life. Though, my less self indulgent years have been spent trying to figure out which mental handicap Ive been lucky enough to experience, I dont think I have anything other than a lull in selflessness. 
Asked my therapist if she thinks I'm bipolar, I dont remember us getting into it much, asked if she thinks I have borderline personality, she told me, ""when a borderline person walks in a room, you know. You're not borderline.""
Every fight I had with my ex I shouted at him for being a narcissist but honestly, I think this is it. If I do have the luxury to blame my poor social skills on a misfire in my brain, then narcissism would be it. 
Back to my arm, it stings. Randomly it'll do that, years at a time. It reminds me of the amount of contempt I've held toward myself. The utter disdain, embarrassment, hate, for myself. 
Sometimes my arm hurts, where my scars are which were put there 9 and 14 years ago.
I hated myself when I was 12, when I was 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26 years old. 
Today I'm 27, have been for about two weeks or so. 
Twenty-seven, alive, alone, in my own apartment, in a state miles away from my past lives, in a place where only one person knows anything at all about me... well that's a lie. 
I can't seem to get away from my past no matter how far I think I could disappear. A previous co-worker, who should have remained in the past, ironically moved to the same state as me during the same month. 
Now here we are, discussing when we will meet up again and rekindle whatever relationship we had before. 
I cannot run away. My life won't let me. It has been too fulfilled with bodies of humans whom I've formed some sort of impression on. 
My life won't let me leave. I've tried since I was 12. I thought I could die, i thought i could do these silly, childish things.
I thought i could drink myself to death but instead, for over a decade, all I did was waste time.
So here I am, buying one bottle of wine several months apart at any give time. I have one sitting in my kitchen now, unopened. 
Here I am.

Well today that changed. In class today all i could think about was how id do it, what song id play, who to write a note to. All of that i figured out in a span of an hour.
Everything else that came to mind made me feel down, but for some reason thinking of my death actually calmed me.

"Meds making you exhausted? : I'm currently taking 4 different medications for my depression. Rexulti, citalopram, topirimate and lithium. I am constantly tired and think the meds may be attributing to this. I'll sleep a full 8 hours and  have a cup of coffee or two in the morning and still feel exhausted. It's gotten worse ever since my dosage of rexulti was upped so thats why I think it may be connected. 
I really want to wean off my meds because of the tiredness and they generally make me feel really flat   but I'm afraid my depression will come back if I stop.

As in, retiring quietly at 60 or labouring till I'm 70+.  Ok, sigh, it is what it is.  People fn suck.  Wish I was smarter.  And less trusting.
I'm 53, dedicated my career to this organisation.  No other prospects really as it's highly specialised.  My fault I guess, should have diversified.  Shouldn't have let my job define me. Fk.
I've been divorced about 15 years.  No romantic prospects, apparently I'm not all that attractive.  Or wealthy.  Or charismatic.  Online dating is... if you've done it you'll know.
No friends.  None.  Zero.  If I go away I don't even have anyone to feed the cat.  I'm a loner.  Not by choice.

"What does Moderately Severe depression mean? : I know I am depressed and I have taken a couple of questionnaire at the Doctors office and it comes out to be moderately severe. I feel incredibly anxious sometimes where I just feel like I am against a wall and I usually end up crying. I feel so powerless when I am like that and in the middle of my anxiety and crying, I hate myself for crying, for feeling so powerless. I seriously have no idea how other people do it. Do they all feel sad and just cheer up after a while ? I am not sure. I have friends who care about me. But to open up to anyone the level of depression I am in, I think I would just scare them off. I dont want anyone to know either. Somehow, being depressed feels like a failure. I have an highly functioning work life.. But the moment I am alone with my thoughts I break down. It usually stops when I am drained out of my energy and then I feel silly about the whole ordeal. During my episodes, I constantly think about getting some help .. to talk to a professional.. But when that has passed, somehow I just feel that was not a big issue and almost all of us probably depressed and its no reason to go to a doctor.. Any advice would help. 
Thanks!",severe

Everything feels pointless, I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy. Drugs have been my entire life since I was 14, and all my “friends” were met through them.

"14 m, depression hit like a bus today, and I honestly just want to talk/vent to someone : I’ve been trying to write about what’s happened today for like and hour now, but I keep discarding what I wrote. I think it will just be easier to talk to someone.
So today I’ve been just crying on and off since this morning as I’ve realized how lonely I actually am. Not to mention I was bullied today at lunch and was physically forced out of my seat. None of my friends stood up for me at all or even asked if I was ok, so I’m pretty sad about that.
I’ve also just been struggling with depression for about a month now. Like I have no motivation to be productive or to get work done. I have so much late work for school that I haven’t even looked at yet. So that’s giving me a lot of anxiety and stress. My grades are also slipping as I’m starting to fail a lot of my classes; despite being an all A student last year.
Having panic attacks and crying have kind of just became a normal things for me; and nobody else knows what I’m going through. I’ve been also been staying up really late on school nights, just to try and avoid going to school the next day.
I suffer from ADD, dyspraxia, and misophonia; so I’m already not that fun to be around. I also feel like I’m kind of boring, or monotonous as I honestly have lost interest in everything. My self esteem and confidence are also really low as of today. 
So I’ve really started to truly think about all these things today and I’ve just been super depressed, and have been crying on/off. It would just be kind of nice having someone to talk and vent to during these hard times :) or maybe someone to at least relate to, so feel free to dm me or leave a comment.
Also any advice on what to do would also be appreciated",severe

"Slasher Flick with some Girl on Girl Action... or inaction? : my husband is going to be disappointed when he finds them. but that was the only thing that felt an option. I haven't cut myself in about 10 or 11 years, but over the last 2 days I've created a pretty big mess of my leg. it just felt so good to be in control of something in me for a change. I've been having daily meltdowns, extreme mood swings for months, and now I am at the psychotic break. I really wish in-patient was a financially realistic option, because I know I am at that point, and need to commit myself for a bit. I just keep trying to survive another day. But my behavior to and around others isn't something I can let slide anymore. I have a ridiculously complicated backstory medically, physically, socially that make me the bundle of fun I am now. I am officially considered to fall under long-term disability because I can only function in a very controlled environment (my house) with out severe vestibular symptoms, and essentially my cognitive abilities to disappear. 
Over the past 2 months I decided to give in and experience a sexual relationship with another girl. She had been interested in me in years, and I only found out a year ago, when I had a panic attack and said I couldn't do it and was afraid it was her and my husband trying to have an excuse to hookup. So they dropped it, until it came up again in November,  and I said I wanted to try it. My husband supported it, hell he helped orchestrate it. We just had to wait a while for her fiance to get on board.
We finally did and I got to experience having sex with another woman... and it was unbelievably amazing.  I always thought I was just bi-curious, but I didn't know if I really felt that way about women or if it was just a kink. Definitely more than just a kink. I want to explore this new side of me so much more. 
So I desperately wanted to experiment more, I was in this new scary place in my life, and suddenly felt alone in it. She's so much more nonchalant about it. I'm not looking for love, but it was really meaningful to me that it was with her. We're both super bonkers and depressed, and planning her wedding. So we were trying to develop this really close friendship/support system, but also have sex for fun. The sex part is hard to make happen. in 2 months since my first time we've done it 2 1/2 times. 
She has a lot going on, and she is struggling pretty hardcore with her own depression. we just can't match up. she'll say how desperately she wants to get her hands on me, but the majority of the time our plans don't work out, or if we're together other people are there preventing us from being able to explore more.
I don't think she's really that interested anymore, and that she isn't in a place to help me through this sexual identity journey. And I am too emotionally unstable I can't handle rejection after rejection. I want to have this with her so bad, but not at the expense of anybody involved. I just don't know how to end that side of things without breaking her. But if I keep going like this... it won't be good. I've been emptying bottles of wine and liquor, taking extra xanax and my happy pills, nothing helps. I'm trying to get into therapy, but I don't know when that will start, and there isn't an overnight fix.
I'm at my wit's end. I have 14 new, nice and long cuts on my body I'm hoping I can keep hiden.but seriously starting again I remembered how easy it was to slash one more, and another, and watch how beautiful the blood looks seeping up through the channels I created for it. I think about suicide all the time, but if I did take my own life it would be a mistake. I know that as much of a burden as I am I can't do that to my husband and parents. And hell, I have so much more in life I want to experience.  I just feel everything crumbling beneath me. 
I have been intoxicated since like 6:30 pm, and now it's 4:21 am. I took Ambien and fell asleep around 9:30pm, eventually took another Ambien and a glass of wine. I'm exhausted, but I know my brain isn't ready to let me get a break.
I just wish I was capable of dealing with my own shit, and moving on. Figuring out how to be just friends again, and be someone she can talk about her mental health issues with. It's just all falling apart and both she and my husband are either annoyed, disappointed, or angry with me (or all of the above). I feel alone, because every time I try to explain why I feel hurt, it's like some joke. Oh she's being crazy again! I don't know what is crazy or sane, or real or an illusion anymore. All I feel is fear, pain, rejection, and embarrassment. 
If anyone has a magic fix it button,  or the power to tell me to suck it up and that actually work, hit me up! 😅",severe

"I keep falling and don't know how to get back up : I tired, really really tired and I don't know what to do. I keep falling and falling everyday to new depths. I'm disappointed in the person I have become and the person I see in the mirror. I'm really depressed and have noone to talk to about it. A little bit of context, I'm African and well in my culture noone believes depression is a real illness, to them you are just lazy or stupid (well not all Africans believe that) so their solution, you just have to get back up and work hard. I didn't know about depression or that I'm depressed, until I was in university and had access to the internet, but by then I was already sucked in deep into the black hole. I can't afford to go to a doctor and have an official diagnosis, but I know myself and I know I'm seriously depressed (if that is how it's said). Bottom line, I'm depressed, not 'kill myself depressed', but I have 'given up and I can't get out of bed depressed.' luckily for me, I have parents who care enough to look after me(I'm 29 by the way, female) even when I'm not working, we are not rich, but doing okay. My brother also has depression, his was so bad, well as bad as mine, but I knew how to hide and pretend, he didn't care anymore, so they took him to a doctor etc, they discovered he had depression(they don't believe it though) but the support us, so they were will to get him on the 3 month anti depressants course his doctor suggested, but my brother did not show any signs of improvement, so my parents decided to stop paying for the expensive medication and they believe that this depression has to do with his personality. So they gave up on him, he is 31 by the way, so he has never worked, got expelled from 1 university and my parents never gave up on him, but now they have completely given up on him. They just let him stay at home and his like a ghost, only gets out of his bedroom to eat, noone notices him anymore, my parents just make sure there is food in the house. I don't want to end up like that, so when I got an opportunity to teach English in China(I procrastinated on it a lot though) I took it last minute, thought I would change, get rich work from myself etc, I have a good business plan, which I formed and planned for this 1 month I was lucid enough to do it. 
Problem is, I can't really get out of bed, the only reason I can get out of bed is to teach, don't want to lose my job. However, most of the days I'm just in bed day dreaming. I had plans for this year, big plans, and was going to do them slowly, then the coronavirus happened and we have been on lock down. It's now end of February and I have done nothing, have been in bed all along gained 10kgs, I'm now 120kgs, which is bad so bad, the thing is I don't remember what I did the past 2 months. This happens a lot, spend large amounts of time in a haze, I don't even function a lot. I have read all the solutions on fighting depression and anxiety and none seem to work for me, heck I can't even master the will to try them, I want to fight depression without taking medication, but it's not easy.

With the help of my therapist things got a bit better over the past year, but now it's like nothing has changed at all. Been thinking about my teeth a lot. They look fucking disgusting, since I didn't care about them at all. Now it holds me back from going out into public, talking to people, smiling, laughing. I've gained weight, too. I've always struggled with my weight, but this is the heaviest I've ever been. I fucking hate myself. 
I wanted to get better, I swear. After so many years of finding comfort in depression, I finally wanted to get out of this hole, but the decisions I made in the past are fucking haunting me and pulling me back inside. I can't look into a mirror without being disgusted. I don't want anyone to see me like this. So I went back to staying in bed, back to fucked up sleeping patterns and bad hygiene and not talking to anyone. I wish I wasn't such a mess. Such an ugly, disgusting failure.",severe
"My suicide attempt : I never realized it till now but I should have been hospitalized many times in my past. I have attempted suicide 5 times and failed every. single. time.  With every attempt, I have gotten closer to not waking up but still haven’t found the perfect concoction. I usually drink too much wine and then take somewhere between 15-30 pills of over the counter sleeping pills. I started with 10 pills thinking that that would be enough and now I’m up to 30 pills. Next time I’ll try 50. The last time I tried, the next day I’m usually very out of it and have a hard time functioning but I usually can make it through the day. I should be going to the ER but I never do because I don’t want them to think I’m doing it for attention. So, I just go about my day hoping that nobody will ask too many questions. If I go to the ER for a suicide attempt, I know that I will be put on a 24hr hold to be properly assessed by a mental health professional and I don’t want that because I don’t want to draw attention to myself. I don’t want people to think I’m mentally sick because of the stigmas. I’ve gotten so much negative feedback anytime I open up to people. They usually tell me to get over it because they think I’m faking it and that my feelings aren’t valid. I don’t want to be seen as trying to get attention. It would be hard for me to accept that I’m actually sick. I don’t think I deserve the help but yet I’m so prepared to kill myself. When is the time to reach out and how do I help myself. I’m so stuck right now. Even after seeing a therapist, I didn’t know what to say when I was in therapy so for the most part it was just three 50mins sessions of ya sitting in silence because I couldn’t define why I was there. Eventually I just stopped showing up and now I have no hope that there’s help for me. The meds I was put on didn’t work and I was put on 3 different types...maybe I am making this all up but yet I still would rather just kill myself than live a miserable life that involves me faking all of my emotions because I don’t know what they really feel like anymore. It’s driving me mad and I think I’m going to attempt a 6th attempt soon. Hopefully this time it will work.",severe
"Please help me if you can : Anybody knows what should i do?
Im guy 24 years old. 4-5 years ago i started having panict attacks which developed into GaD, depression, and ocd(intrusive thoughts) and other phobias. First theee years were pure hell then 2 years ago a thought popped im my head what if im gay? Which spiraled into having 24/7 gay thoughts. One day after years of suffering and when i started having this thoughts i feel something shut down. I started feeling numb, sexually and emotionally. Since then i lost my libido, my attraction to women, i still get erection on girls but its harder and only with touches. I feel like i lost my sexuality. Before this i was romantic full of love towards girls. 22 years of my life i lived with motivation tu get stronger to be able to protect and provide for my future wife and family. Now 2 years i feel completely numb. I domt get any warm feelings crushes on girls, i barely have morning woods, dont get spontaneuous erections. I recently started antidepressant, which i hope give me relief to anxiety and help me get my emotions back. 
My question would be if any of you went through something similar? Im afraid i lost myself and wont be able to get myself back. Since i have this i dont feel like me, i wasnt aware how sexuality is important to one person. Now im more asexual, but it doesnt fit to me, and im depressed really because of it.
Anybody has some story of hope?",severe

"I am jealous of people who can get drugs that can numb the pain : I just had a revelation and I need to tell someone. 
I have had depression since I was 10. My narcissistic dad has been emotionally and physically abusive a long before that. My mom cheating triggered his behaviour. I'm close to 30 now and they are still together. This has made my teenage years hard and naturally due to shitty homelife as a person I was a wreck, which led to me being bullied in school for 10 years. I hated life in school and at home. I almost killed myself when I was 12 but did't because I wanted my little brother to have one person in their life that did't cause him pain. It has been a close call multiple times since that. 
Currently I live with my boyfriend of 8 years in our own home a happy life. I have been in therapy for 4 years and am currently unempoyed to focus on therapy to get better and he supports it 100%. Seems nice right? I am low contact with my parents but have thought going no contact many times. I do not sleep. I don't think I have ever had a proper good night sleep. I have nightmare seasons (that's what I call them..) and have nightmare every night for weeks. I'm going on 3weeks and 4 nights at the moment, so I have not rested properly during this time. I seek comfort in food and occasionally in alcohol. I have never drank alcohol to party, I drink because I neeeeed a break from my head that keeps telling me to kill myself. I really want to die. I think of it as a dream that I want to achieve. I would love to be freed from this pain that I feel everyday. I have depression, anxiety and PTSD. I am tired. 
I am writing this because I was watching a documentary about teenagers with drug problems. I related to them so much, their pain is what I feel. The thing that scared me was that I found myself being jealous. I wanted the drugs that would make me numb for a while. I have never tried anything other than alcohol, but I think that if I had had the chance I would have gone that road and I would have killed myself. I would have peace and would be in eternal dream or nightmare, with my luck it would be a nightmare. Luckily I have no way to obtain any sort of drugs, just more therapy. I have so many mixed feelings about life at the moment, the pain seems just too big. 
On one hand I have an amazing life that could be even better once I get better. On the other hand it seems that I have no power and no strenght in me to be any better. I just would like a few days without the pain, just a little break so I can sleep and gather energy. I feel like this whole text is a mess, I'm sorry.",severe
"The world is 100% at fault for my problems : I unapologetically say that, I will not ""improve"" in the way other people want me to, I have no interest in living in a world full of cruel assholes and hypocrites who will walk over dead bodies for money.

"I noticed something : It took me a few months to realize this but my pharmacist has been treating me very nice every time I visit to pickup my anti-depressant medication. She would always ask me how I’m doing and always smile at me. It’s not much but you don’t notice that with any other pharmacist. At first I found it odd that she was specifically being really nice to me but now I realize she was probably doing it because she knows I have depression and she wanted to cheer me up. So, to that pharmacist, I wanna thank you for that. You were the only person that interacts with me and it slightly lifts my mood when you treat me like a person. :)",severe

"Daily Thoughts : I feel a terrible mess. I'm constantly in my own feelings trying to evaluate how to feel better.
I struggle with no social network, no friends, no family. The ones I do have occasionally come around don't want to hear me talk, they leave if I start talking about how I feel. They only come over to ask for money.  I have no friends. They've been a big addition to my problems. My best friend of twenty years slept with my girlfriend (the mother of my children) at the time. My other closest friends have went to prison for their bad habits. I've broke my bad habits thinking it would help clear my mental state. 
I self loathe and drink to fight my demons, they just swim really well so it doesn't help much
My wife and I have been in rocky moments and I feel all I have is her and my children. She has tried to leave several times before marriage and after marriage. Lately I have been feeling like I don't even have her. I cannot and will not let my kids know the side of me that is troubled. I put on a fake smile every single day.
No one listens to me when I am having an anxiety attack or a depressive state and am crying. The last big attack from anxiety I had I was told that I can't help as much or it's not the same for my wife to talk to me while I'm dealing with my own problems and she feels like she can't. 
Some days I feel like I need something to happen to take me out of action. Other days I debate making it happen myself. I have struggled for years and no one listens. I pay some person for therapy that is only listening because of money, but then tries to tell me how to handle things in ways I've already tried.
My mother is dead, has been since I was a child. My father is a piece of garbage who sells drugs and was abusive growing up. Why am I like this? Why was I placed in the position I'm in? Why was it like this growing up? Why did someone try to molest me when I was a teenager? Why didn't anyone do anything once they saw it or heard it?
Why am I not good enough for anyone to care? Why am I not happy? Why do I feel this way?

"i feel so stuck ... : i dont know what to do anymore. or where to start to even change things. im 29 &amp; as far back as i can remember ive suffered with depression but just didnt have a name for it until later teens. im also bipolar 2, have massive depression/anxiety &amp; have adhd. ive been on various medicines that always either stopped working for me or just didnt work at all to the point where i was over it all. now all im on is a low dose of adderall because it helps with making my insides feel like they arent squirming around. ive been thru a ton of family trauma and the like, &amp; ive done just about everything for myself til this point in life. now im just in a place where i have two jobs just to survive really. first one is a 9-5 office type that i literally do nothing in. the work is so minimal that i just feel like im wasting away. second job is bartending twice a week. job number one drains my soul because i feel like im just wasting away under an incubator type light in an all grey office setting doing nothing on auto pilot. every day is the same and i feel like its meaninless, but how does one go out and get a new job that pays just as well if one has no time to do so because all they do is work? i feel like i dont have motivation to do anything anymore, down to basic tasks. something that realistically would take me all of 10 mins to do i put off and off and off and then everything just feels like it festers. im starting to get into the funk where i dont even do basic things for myself anymore. i guess maybe my main thing is this job but like how the fuck do you change something so massive when you literally dont have a moment to breath because you work monday through saturdays? by the time sunday comes im basically just a shell. 
i feel like everything has no meaning in my life at this point. i feel like i live on complete auto pilot. alot of the time i feel like i cant even remember my days. i guess what im asking for is just how to gain back some type of motivation to keep pushing and fucking genuinely be able to smile and feel happy and not have this warped mask on constantly. PLEASE &amp; i cant stress enough do not comment and tell me to excercise. im not over weight or anything but thats not the solution to pump my endorphins up. i went to the gym and tried various types of things in that realm for over a year and it just made me miserable because i was doing something i didnt wanna do at all and never took a liking. my favorite thing to do is create art and thats what makes me happy but its very hard to do that when your brain basically feels fried out from just basic everyday tasks. how do i get back to loving myself and be happy about things in my life? how do i start a change? i feel so stuck ...
my apologizes if this is rambling and incoherent, i just wasnt sure where else to turn for anyone to get it. i just wanna change things and be the best me &amp; im at the point where all i can do is ask for some type of help.",severe
"Anyone have any tips for getting through college with depression? : I’ve had general and social anxiety for as long as I can remember.

"A new low : Hi all. I never usually talk about my mental health with anyone but I’m at a point where I feel invisible and just need to put my thoughts into words so I can feel seen, even if nobody replies. 
I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since my teens but have always found some way of distracting myself until now. I was on medication for a short time that made me feel very sick a few years ago but that is the extent of me addressing my mental health medically. In 2014 I was a victim in a violent assault that left me scarred but never really took any steps to deal with that trauma either.
I was working in a job that paid my bills but left me very unhappy up until the end of last year when I decided to quit and try to find something that made me want to get up in the morning and do my best. Unfortunately I’ve not found anything since and the struggle of job hunting has really knocked my self-esteem - especially when I’m turned down for roles with very basic requirements. I can’t help but feel unwanted by society at large and I’m only trying to make ends meet at this point.
On top of that I had a very loving and supportive boyfriend up until yesterday when he decided to call off our relationship. We’ve been together for nearly 5 years and I’ve now lost my most important source of comfort and one of my closest friends.
I don’t really cry any more but have been weeping on and off for the last 24 hours. I keep telling myself that I am strong and that I’ve been through so much and will make it through this too but I’m struggling to believe it at the moment. I don’t think I’ve ever been at a point before where everything has collapsed so hard all at once.
If you’ve read this then thank you - I’m so tired of feeling unwanted and irrelevant when I’m just trying to keep going day to day.",severe

"I need help making the choice to get better : I’ve been talking with multiple people in my support group and all of them say I need to choose whether I want to stay in the dark, or if I want to see the light. My main problem is I have no motivation whatsoever. So when I’m told to do something it’s very difficult to start that task. So when I’m told I should make a decision about getting better it’s hard. Obviously the choice would be to pick the getting better side. But I’ve been in the dark so long it’s hard for me to change how I’ve been feeling.

Are you kidding me?  You know how the earth was formed and people evolved over millions of years but not why my brain makes serotonin but then refuses to use it slowly rather than quickly?  Or maybe that's not even it!!!  Maybe I have a dopamine problem.  Who.  Fucking.  Knows.

"Cycling Around : It feels like my depression and anxiety has trapped me in this mental loop of trying to get better and then going back to square one. I'll get some guidance from my therapist or my counselor and I'll say I'll try it, but once I leave that temporary safety zone, my mind just forgets and goes back to self destruction mode. It's impossible to talk to my parents because it always backfires or turns into a lecture, and I don't have friends who actually provide what I need. I am not saying that they are bad friends, but it's like everyone gives me advice instead of affection. I know people are scared of me being suicidal, I'm very vocal about it because I feel like I have no energy to even hide it. Unfortunately, I'm just always saying I'm not doing good mentally or that I want to kill myself and I can tell that people are getting tired of it. I have dreams about my friends leaving me or about being chronically lonely. I'm in a constant state of fear of putting myself out there because it never does any good, but I also get shit for not talking to people about my issues. At the same time, these people who get mad at me for not talking are the same ones who can't aid me, so I feel better just figuring shit out by myself, but coincidentally, that's the most dangerous spot because no one else is there to comfort you and tell you it's alright while you feel like you're worth nothing and deserve to die.

"Need help explaining depression : Ok this might be long. I've suffered from treatment resistant major depression since I was 13 (I'm 37).

"Depression ruined my life /vent : This is obviously just a venting post because I can't really tell anyone, no one understands what it's like. I know it's gross but I just feel sorry for myself today.
I grew up in a broken family. My dad is a good yet weird human that never expresses feelings and doesn't think psychology or depression is real. Mother abused me in childhood (partially because she was depressed) then left and now she wants to spend time with me because I'm grown up and she hates kids. (same, but I'm not gonna have any!!)
I grew up pretty isolated and found much older friends over the internet soon. I was always neurotic, had social and general anxiety since preschool, depression came when I was about 12 and worsened when I moved out to study (14).
I'm not gonna call myself a prodigy or a genious lol not at all. Art is the only thing I didn't suck at so I let my anxious brain take over, became very workaholic and was somewhat famous in my country's digital art community for being good at young age. Since I put all of my self-esteem into drawing, I burned out pretty soon after dealing with depression. At 16 I no longer drew. It was and still is so painful to see people who are or were mediocre becoming better than me. Hell to study an art school like this. I've tried to paint again but it will never be the same. I don't love it. At best, I don't mind it. It hurts.
I got into uni (game art/illustartion) based only on the shit I painted when I was 13-15. How sad that is?! I can't do anything else and when I don't try to draw it hurts even more.
I fall into depression ruts every two months or so when I exhaust myself trying to be ok and functioning because I don't want to get hospitalized. 
I feel like shit, I didn't progress in life at all these years and I know it's never gonna get better because this is practically my last chance before I have to make serious money to keep my father and cats alive. 
This is just the tip of the iceburg, of course I have many more fun problems like chronic fatigue, allergy to everything, financial struggles etc but who doesn't. 
I know it probably doesn't sound that bad but I just can't describe how bad I am feeling - or rather not feeling anymore. I've been so close to killing myself many times, the only thing holding me back is that I have to care for my elderly father and cats and no one else will if I die. 
I'd fucking ace life by being hardworking if my brain didn't sabotage me from young age. I' m just mad at life. I know a lot of people who are barely trying but will be much more successfull because I'll be dead.

That's my issue. I think my intelligence is dropping. I talk to my brain every single moment. I sometimes predict something he will say. He claims it's because it's my brain but sometimes I don't even predict it. It just comes out of it. I might be saying that because I want to make myself happy. I guess so? I can't. I can't stand living stupid. I can't stand living stupid because I don't enjoy doing things. Walking, meeting friends. I'm pretty good at making friends in someway I don't even know. I think that made me this shitty. The country is shitty. Can't buy anything. Worst economy. Stupid people. I am stupid. I can understand what's stupid. Those exam questions are stupid. This school is stupid. Teachers are also so stupid. They all say to my parents ""your son is so so so fucking smart and could be the 1st but no, he doesn't want to work hard."" Might be true? No. My mom takes it all serious. My friends call me smart. Some of them not. Some of them do. Some of my teachers think I'm cheating because I get better than his favorite students without even listening to the class. My brain. Feels like I'm going dizzy? I wish I could go all insane. Not have my mind. I would like to die if reincarnating was an option. People here believe Allah. Okay. I barely do. I do believe when I'm stuck. Did I ever think it was so real? I invested through how would we be here. Not an answer. Why would our soul stuck? No meaning. Who the fuck thinks we're all gonna be in afterlife world? I sometimes do actually. I do. Meh. I don't know. Reincarnating is the best option I think I have. I love it. It feels good. It sounds good. I don't know but 10x people died from the current people. I think we also reincarnate as the other beings. I want to be a human. A men. A men that has a white skin tone. I'm not black. I'm actually light-brown or brown. People like to call them terrorists or some shit in the terms of racism. I don't get offended? I think about it. Stop treating your friend like they enjoy it when you enjoy it. That's not true. Please stop. I can't stop thinking about this and no one will read this. Why would they? I can't even speak proper English. I'm worried about if my friends are going to find about this but only 1 person uses it. Literally 1. He is in somewhere where high-iqs go. No one explained to me how would you do this exam. I'm lazy. I'm not going to do all of this questions. I finished the exam in 10 minutes. I knew it was wrong. No one would be bothered to all this. I only remember one part from it. I guess it was the iq test. I was looking at my friend to cheat. I didn't think the way he did. I don't know why did he think that. I also remember the question. It's been a while. I scored higher than all of my people somehow. It was 110. I had no understanding of IQ meant and I didn't even know what was that number. I didn't even know what was that exam. I feel like I never joined in it. We all scored about 105-110. I am just ahead with 2 points. I was cringe. I think I wasn't completely aware of how my brain does. I never thought about it. I was happy. I was really happy. No one was hitting my head. My friends were treating me good. My grades were top. The economy was good. I was good. I was school 1st for one-time. Literally one-time lol. I was able to do all math by my head when I was that age. I guess I still can but I also think I'm stupid. I can't do any of the new math problems. I don't understand my teachers. They just explain and go on. Explaining 5 minutes, solving 35. I remember. I can see how people see me. No, I'm not joking. I can look into anyones eye and see how they see me from perspective. It's scary. It's like looking through a mirror. I can't imagine or can I? I can imagine. I clearly don't remember I imagine. I can. I can't remember. It's only for the time I'm doing it. I am 13 yo. Don't take me seriously. I can't even talk proper English. I don't want anyone I know to find about this. I'm sad. I lied about my age for a while. No one ever suspected me until I told the truth. My friend didn't unfriend me. He's still there. I love him. He thinks I'm smart but it's not the reason I love him. He can understand. Why is it so fucking hard to understand? Why is it so fucking scary to live? I feel like I'm seeing something all-night. I want to play chess. I'm bad at it. One day I get good. Ultra good. I go 300 rating above. Other day I have like 2 missed wins, 10 blunders. I'm calm. I act like I'm not because attraction. I'm an attraction dog. I don't know why am I still typing this but I will go on. I want to type whatever I have. It feels better that way. No one is going to respond though. It will be the saddest part. I now feel like my brain is shitty. When I talk to him he says he is going to repair. He actually said he had it repaired. Since he did. I feel dizzy. I don't sit normally. I can't sit normally. People seem so stupid. At least in my country. What is this? I could make better questions. That doesn't ask anything. This education is bad. If you think it's good, it's bad. If you do good on this, you understand dumb. You  read it. It feels like you're living in it. You read the other, it's bad. It doesn't feel like you're living in it. The answer is 2nd. To the question which asks you which one of those makes you feel live in it. The answer is all because 2-3 stupid words. Quite good. I have to remember all of those useless shit. I won't even use any of them. I don't care. I never did. I won't. I have the big exam after 4 months and I didn't even study a bit for 4 years. I can't. It's boring. Should I? I think I am going to. I will get a PC if I do so. That's the only reason why I have to. My PC is bad. Economy is bad. My parents are not buying one. This one doesn't even have good specs. My dad asks the worker if PC is good and buy it. We can't return it, I know I could get a better one for cheaper. He will be sad. I don't want to get my dad sad. I get angry but I don't want to get anyone sad. I feel sad. I feel bad. I don't think I'm feeling good. The only thing that would motivate me is a brain x-ray. I wonder. I wonder if those hits did anything. I don't know. Did they? I wish they didn't. I'm shy to tell this to my parents. It's stupid. I want to kill myself if they did. I don't want to if they didn't. I don't want to live stupid. I can't laugh at what you laugh at. The fake smile hides it all. I think I'm a clown. I want to change. I can't. It's hard but I keep doing it. I now look at that. I don't even know why did I type this much. Who is going to read that? I don't know. What do I know? Nothing. I'm in a mental loop.",severe
"I've never been officially diagnosed.... I'm sorry : And I feel ashamed about it, but I also I feel like the people in my life would be ashamed if they knew, and that's what's keeping me from saying anything or getting help.
I had two mental health checks when I went to the obgyn a couple years ago. The first was the initial and the second time they had to have a follow up because I answered like I needed help. I lied the second time because my mom asked me about it and I was afraid to talk to her about it.
So I stick to toughing it out, trying self care apps, and making secret accounts to vent or use when I'm in a mood.

"I have been suffering with chronic depression (diagnosed by doctor) but cant bring the strength to tell my friends so I call it ""Brain Fog"" Becuase I have to talk about it somehow. : I have been suffering from chronic depression for the past 3 years and it is the worst thing ever but I have managed to bring it to a swinging sort of thing where it only happens maybe 3 to 4 times a week but each time it happens it can last up to 3 weeks (at least that was the longest one for me). The only person who knows is my mom and doctor but I have to talk to my friends and girlfriend about it but I just cant bring myself to tell them so when it happens i get all angry because that is how I cope with it but also it hurts me so bad and all I want to do is just lie on the ground and just cry but I have to keep going and keep pushing through because I have to many responsibilities to just stop doing everything. And i constantly want to die but I keep thinking about my mom and girlfriend and friends. So basically in order to talk about it I say that I am having ""Brain Fog"" which is basically something I made up in order for my friends to sort of understand and sympathize with me.

"Depression &amp; Spiraling Thoughts : A little about me...I am a 34 year old female. I used to be a gym rat, working out 6 days a week, taught a class even, I'm a musician, an insurance broker, crazy cat lady and love cleaning...December 2018 I made the decision to leave my husband of 7 years because we simply weren't seeing eye to eye anymore. I started dating someone very shortly after that. I moved into my own place, traded in my car, and then started to get into some financial trouble. Balancing these things all hit me at once. I stopped going to the gym, couldn't even imagine playing my guitar or my piano, the sight of a dish in the sink would throw me into a panic attack...""I have to wash two plates AND fold clothes, *OMG, how*."".....
My dad, over the course of a year, has given me a total of $10k to pay off debts and just generally pay bills ($4k last summer and 6k recently). Out of nowhere, I spiraled into a depression. I've had some pretty bad anxiety for awhile, but as soon as he gave me that second loan, I spiraled out of control with guilt, which quickly turned into a severe depression/anxiety. I have already gone through my 2 weeks of PTO (and more). I can't go to work because I feel like I have the flu all the time, and now I'm scared of being able to able to pay back the loan, make rent, etc. Every day of work I missed just made me feel worse, but the thought of going made me crazy. ""*What is happening to me? Everyone is mad at me, I'm such a disappointment"".*
Every day is a struggle for me. I love my boyfriend, but I feel like my depression is pushing him away, my co-workers are mad at me, and you sure learn quick who your real friends are during a major life change.  I've lost several ""friends"" over the past year, and obviously my ex in-laws are all upset with me - understandable since I was the initiator of the divorce. I also had to leave two cats behind which were my world (sounds silly, but they were). 
Basically, the guilt just eats away at me. I am one of those people that can't stand the thought of people being mad at me or not like me. I cannot just brush it off or say screw it. I care ***too*** much what people think. People that don't even matter to me or have no significance in my life. I think *way* too hard into the future, and worry about everything that hasn't even happened yet. ""It's like I'm trying to control, and protect my future self from getting hurt somehow but I don't even know what those things are. So much so that this why I've been missing work because I was so anxious and depressed that I could not fathom eating, which was making me sick...I can't go to work, can't pay my bills, will get kicked out of my place, my boyfriend will move on, will lose my car, will have to move back in with my parents, and be lonely, sick and sad forever. I will just be known as that ""sick girl"". This is the way my mind spirals out of control on a daily basis. I've seen a psychiatrist, a therapist, had multiple visits with my doctor, so now the doctors bills are going to start piling on top of it. 
Currently I am taking 50mg of Zoloft, which has been beneficial to me in the past (roughly 2014), but I stupidly decided to ween myself off of it around the same time I started going through a divorce. Like I wanted to prove to myself I could handle all of this on my own without the use of medications. *Wrong.* 
I was also taking around 10mg of Ambien every night for sleep and it worked great for me. I had no side effects whatsoever. However, I started to run out way to early. I was sleeping a lot and napping so I'd break them into pieces to take naps. The doctor became alerted to this during our last visit and refused to refill it for me, which of course, sent me into a literal tailspin and severe panic. I was throwing up when I left the office because I was so distraught (and still hadn't eaten). My mind went reeling thinking ""how am I going to function and handle all of this stress if I can't ever sleep, how can I work?"" Literally thinking I would die eventually from exhaustion and depression. My psychiatrist then prescribed me 15mg of Remeron, which seems to have been working ok but it's just not the same. I hate starting new medications. I went through all the classic symptoms, sadness, anger, etc. My parents, boyfriend's parents, my siblings, boyfriend, all started to become worried and concerned for me which made me feel worse. I just feel like I'm going to ""run out of time"" as I keep saying. Basically, that everyone around me is going to abandon me before I have a chance to heal.
This week, I'm back at work and have been sleeping somewhat better and doing my best to stay positive and just focus on work, pushing past the feelings and just trying to enjoy my life day by day instead of trying to fix everything. Of course, my mind is still reeling and I'm still not feeling great, but taking baby steps. Does anyone relate to any of this? Thanks",severe
"What do i do? : I've done everything. I've gone to doctors and therapists. I've tried various meds that made my depression worse. I've tried as hard as I can to fix things in my life. I've tried to make my community better. I've tried to help my country. I feel like I'm out of options. I have no friends, and the only woman I ever loved is half way across the country getting married to the guy she left with. I am trapped in the city I grew up in and I hate it here. It seems like this is the worst possible version of my life. Like I'm being punished for something I did in another life. I just want to feel again. I want that capacity back and be able to trust again. I have no one except my dog and that helps but then it feels like I'm letting him down too. I just need some options. So, what do I do?",severe
"A follow-up on my last post : Just a little update for anyone who cares,
I’m not going IP, it’ll fuck up my relationships and my education. I don’t want to get better, my end goal is to kill myself. Basically I got what I want - a diagnosis, it’s depression (no shit) but I’m going to a different psychiatrist for a second opinion because I think it’s more than that. The first psychiatrist didn’t prescribe anything unless I go IP, so I guess it’s a sign I shouldn’t get help 🙃
So until it’s all over I’ll continue lying and pretending, while imaging myself dead wherever I look.
If I’ll stay alive by 18, maybe I’ll go to IP treatment.
Thanks for everyone who answered and cared, it means a lot ❤️❤️",severe
"feeling numb and everything seems hopeless : I'm in college and technically a sophomore because I took a semester off after having my first big spiral and being diagnosed with depression. I used to stay in my dorm room isolated and not getting out of bed let alone go to class. My mom pays some of my tuition and thankfully I was reimbursed the tuition due to medical reasons and I put the money on last semester but it feels like I get a false sense of hope at the beginning of semesters and then I eventually start isolation myself and stop showing up to classes. I take 150mg of Zoloft and I haven't been taking them so regularly and I've been feeling light headed and I keep sleeping. I've been smoking weed everyday and more and more each day and I always feel happy when I'm high but coming down to my sober self I just feel numb. I haven't been going to class and taking care of myself or even getting my room together. I feel like I'm just destined to this path of failure. There was a post on here that said I don't want to kill myself but I do want to just pause everything. its easier telling people I'm sick or have a stomach bug instead of saying I feel like absolute shit and don't want to leave my bed. My financial aid was taken away from me due to my grades but they said I could appeal it if I had a reasoning and they said I could use my depression as the reasoning but they said they want me to say what type of improvement or things I'm gonna do to get better. But I don't know what to do, counseling doesn't really help me and the medication is fine but I just don't know. I keep getting thoughts about how everything would be so much simpler if I was dead but I don't want to die idk its a whole thing and I feel like I'm just rambling now.

"Why am I having these thoughts and feeling this way : I dont know exactly which sub I should go to so I'm posting here. I'm 21 and I have a great life. Amazing, supportive and loving family and friends, no physical health issues, I'm in community college and I'm doing great with my grades and major. The only thing thats holding me back and making me feel like I'm struggling is my mental state. The main things that are bothering me are why I feel like I cant find meaning in life and why I always worry so much. 
A couple weeks before christmas I just started getting these thoughts and feelings out of the blue about why anything mattered, and what's the point to life. I also have always had anxiety, so that combined with my thoughts have made me fearful that I'm just going to try to kill myself. I never have planned it or remotely considered doing it, I was just fearful of what I might do in the future if that makes sense, thinking worst case scenario. Everywhere I go now I cant seem to shake these almost obsessive thoughts about whether or not I'll lose my mind and crash my car or try to hurt myself. I also feel like I cant find the same pleasure as I did before. Nothing looks as stunning, emotions aren't as strong as before, that kind of thing. I'm also lacking motivation somewhat. I dont feel tired, hopeless, have a reduced appetite, have trouble sleeping though. 
I dont know how to fix how I feel and what I'm thinking. I've tried going for runs outside, eating healthier and reading articles about how to find purpose and gain back my interest in life but it's not helping all that much. I do know for a fact though that ever since I started watching porn when I was younger, I started having social anxiety, mild OCD, reduced pleasure in everything and depression. I feel like a little bit of that has gone away, but my brain still feels off. Ever since I quit watching, I would have moments where I would wonder what it would be like to just die because of these symptoms that I've been having ever since I watched porn. I would go places and experience things afterwards, but those experiences never were amazing and made me feel happy in the same way that I used to feel when I was a lot younger. Just recently, I cant do anything really without wondering what's the means and purpose behind what I'm doing. 
I wish I could just go back to years ago when I was younger, and never had any of these crazy and existential thoughts. I wish my brain go to back normal, as I'm tired of dealing with these thoughts and feelings. 
I guess what I'm asking is, what do I blame here for how I feel and how can I start to fix it? How do I communicate about my struggles? Also, any advice on how you can get back your purpose and meaning in life. I truly just want to feel better. Thanks.",severe
"Stopping medication after many years - Words of advice : I am 22 years old. 2 months ago, I started the slow process of getting off the 125mg of sertraline I have been consistently taking for 2 years (really slowly got up to that amount). I tried two different kind of anti-depressant before that one but I was so young there's no point discussing them. I sacrified a lot to have access to those pills. I was grateful for them and happy to raise the dosage when my doctor felt it was needed.
The pills granted me a pause from my brain. I was able to go to school, earn my degree, work while studying. My mother was happy. I seemed okay. My libido was absolutely annihilated. I was doing okay.
""Okay"" obliviously isn't good enough after 5 years, trying to start your career as an artist. So recently I made a huge decision, the scariest of my life so far. As a result, I am deep into this feeling of emptiness you are left with when you remove something that found its place in you for so long.
I am sure I am not alone going through this.
I thought I was strong enough to go through with it, to finally find my personnality, my sexuality, my real emotions. To make art.
But everything feels wrong. Unsurprisingly.
People keep telling me to just ""Do your yoga!"" ""Pet your cat!"" ""Go volounteer like you did!"" but nothing feels right anymore. The only voice in my head is the one I had all my life before medication. I feel like I didn't take enough time to understand that voice. My psychologists and phychiatrists didn't. My trips to the mental hospital didn't. I should have listened to this voice all this time and instead of ignoring it, I should have tried to change its patterns, I should have tried to silence it myself. I ran away from a problem and it came to bite me in the ass after years and thousands of dollars wasted on false hope of being ""saved from myself"". Professionals have their limits, I shouldn't have put my trust into them. I was so young. I am still so young.
Depression isn't something you fix with pills. My uncle can't get off his meds without feeling like shit, I can't either. But feeling like shit is part of life apparently. I have to go through that, apparently. I chose not to using the ""easy way"", persuaded by my doctor, family, friends, society, science, progress, even in the name of ""life finds a way, no matter how wrong it feels"". 
Depression isn't something you fix going the easy route, and since there's no real easy route anyway, we are left dealing with it the only way we know: following well-meaning advice, just like I did.
Don't feel bad for feeling bad, you need this. It's a sign something is wrong. The ""check engine"" is lit up. It's because you know something is wrong, and there's nothing really wrong with that. But it also means its time to DO something. And yes, pills are useful, but please be careful. Withdrawal is real for me, there is absolutely nothing keeping me alive besides guilt because of this right now. 
I am not saying this to discourage anyone from making the right decision for themselves. I am not the best advice giver, but neither were anyone else when it came to saving myself, which is why I am choosing to share this with you.",severe
"Depression causing crisis in family- Not sure how to feel right now : Hi, my name is Chance. I'm 42 years old, married (to a man, I'm gay) and have two children a daughter 14, and a son 12. My daughter has severe Autism, is verbal but has the mental capacity of a 5 year old. She is partially potty trained, still wears pulls ups, and has increasingly violent and destructive melt downs. I see counseling, am on depression meds, and my daughter has a therapist, goes to a school for MRDD, and had medications for her behaviors though I don't feel they help much. With her behaviors and the stress I'm under I have been having more and more issues with my depression. There are days when I simply can't function anymore. I do the best that I can, my kids are clean, have clean clothes, are well fed, and there has never been any issues of abuse or neglect. They are, for the most part, happy. My son has some resentment towards his sister and between him and my husband and myself her behaviors has caused some stress in our family. I recently had a break down where I was threatening suicide, was arrested and placed in a cell for what I am assuming was for suicide watch. It was just a room with a grate in the floor that was to be used as a toilet, no furniture, I was stripped naked, and given only a blanket. I was there for 24 hours then released but other issues arose from that situation. The police called CPS and due to my house being a mess and unsanitary the children have been temporarily placed in my mothers care. I'm working with CPS as well as some other agencies to clean the house and get some help for the current situation.  We've actually got a lot done, and I am doing my best to get the kids returned. The last thing I want to do is have my daughter placed in a residential facility for autistic children but that may end up being where this leads. For years I have been trying to get help. I've looked into respite care, I've explored every avenue I can think of, I have taken advantage of every service and agency that I know about. Places like the YMCA and other similar programs wont take my daughter for their respite programs or after school programs because of her incontinence and behaviors. At this point I'm just at a loss. I've discussed this all with my mom many many times, I've told her about my troubles, about my daughters behaviors, and mom has continuously swept my concerns under the rug.  She has told me that I need to just stop being depressed and take care of my family and there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to. This is basically what I get every-time I ask for help.  Now that she has had the kids for the past week, she is calling me everyday, several times a day, complaining about my daughter. My daughter screams and throws tantrums, kicks, hit, throws things, knocks over furniture etc... Mom is saying that she just can't take it anymore and that something needs to be done. She's constantly telling me that I need to get the kids back. I told her that I am doing everything I can, that it's up to CPS at this point and I am cooperating fully with them. At this point I don't know what else to do. I'm trying to get the house cleaned, going to court, going to my therapist, and helping my mom as much as I am allowed with the children. I'm just at a loss and worse, I'm starting to get angry with my mother. I don't see how she can so easily dismiss my concerns for years, and then after one week keep complaining to me about what my daughter is doing. She says she feels like she has no life, shes starting to resent my daughter, she is upset that she has to constantly change diapers (pull ups) and she just can't handle it anymore. Valid points all but at the same time, I've been dealing with this for years, not a week, and she never seemed that concerned with my problems. She's now attempting to get respite care and is facing the same issues that I have faced in the past and so shes been calling me wanting me to look into it more, talk to people, talk to CPS, and then gets upset with me when I don't deliver. I'm honestly trying my best, I've her ideas and tips on how to deal with the behaviors but she says she doesn't have the time or energy to devote that much one on one time with my daughter. I told her that it's all part of caring for an autistic child, it's 24/7 not just when you feel up to it. I'd think by now she would understand my depression, and my problems with house cleaning, caring for my daughter, and trying to maintain a healthy family but it just seems like every time something goes wrong she blames me for it. I know that I messed up, I am at fault for what happened, but all I have ever been trying to do is ask for help from anyone. It seems like no one really cared about what was going on until the authorities were involved and everyone is saying they want to help, they want to get a care plan in place, they want to do this and that, but at the same time I feel like the bad guy here, and no one really understands what I've been going through or why I allowed things to get this bad. Sorry for the long post, I just really don't have a lot of people to talk to and needed to get some of this off my chest. Thanks to anyone who reads and comments. Take care and stay safe :)",severe

I blew off a direct order from my step dad, and did it my way so i could go get drunk sooner. He fired me, and i ended up drinking more than i would have. I drank about a gallon of vodka over the course of two nights and even did coke. The morning that i got arrested i was sitting on the edge of my friends bathtub, trying not to get sick. Once i felt better, i started drinking again. My friend asked me to leave because i was sitting on the couch and he wanted the space to lie down. And i didnt care what happened to me so i did. I got pulled over and blew a .16, double the legal limit. Im 20. I got off so lucky, he didnt give me a dui, i got charged with minor in possession of alcohol and paraphernalia (weed pipe)
All i could think about was that i deserved it. I let my depression get the best of me, and i was drinking at least 3 times a week. I knew it was getting out of hand, but i didnt realize the extent until i got busted and was left in the drunk tank to think about my actions. Im restructuring my life. Cutting out people in my life that rely on weed every day, and trying to be more proactive about my life. I feel like i let everyone down. Todays my first day back to work, and i took a 2$/hr pay cut. But i know it's the right thing to do. I was gonna post this in casual conversation but they dont really like topics like this.",severe
"How do I become happier? : I have fallen into such a depression, that I have spent the recent month sleeping in my room entirely. Personal hygiene has become a chore, waking up to wash my face is difficult for some odd reason, and it seems I have to push myself up to get out of bed. 
I have lost a desire to go to the gym, which previously, I had done without a problem. My medication (Buproprion) is not helping at all, instead, it makes me lose my appetite which further makes me feel crappy.
I only work twice weekly due to family insurance since we are all on the same insurance and need to make a certain amount of income to have it. So, there's that.

"Is it my fault? : Little backstory first.
I am a 16 year old male.  Go to a career school.  Have a girlfriend.  Set boundaries with my girlfriend as soon as we decided to go from friends to a relationship.  Been together for 7 (almost 8) months.  I have a bad past with relationships (Being cheated on, getting lied to, etc.).  I have a history with depression, anxiety, and self harm due to family issues and these horrible past relationships.  My family just laughs at me when I tell them how I feel and my girlfriend doesn't like me talking about it.
Story:
One of the boundaries we set was that we wouldn't drink (Mostly due to her making bad decisions in the past while drunk).  We had both agreed and promised on it.  Was fairly easy for me to comply with considering I don't drink or use drugs of any sort.  Recently she was working at an undisclosed fast food chain restaurant.  She has been working there for 6 months and nothing has happened to cause me to raise an eyebrow.  Recently, she was waiting to get off of work.  Sitting with her manager and two of her co-workers. (All guys)  Okay cool ya know, just chilling waiting for the clock to strike quitting time.  Well I asked her if everything was okay because she sent me a picture of herself on snapchat and she looked kind of out of it.  She said, ""Yes baby i promise everything is okay"".  Okay, no reason to be worried right? Wrong.  Once she was home she called me and confessed that she drank alcohol with her male co-workers and then proceeded to lie about it for about an hour.  It wasn't even the drinking part that bothered me.  She could've just said ""hey i had a drink tonight at work"".  But she lied about it.  And now she wonders why I don't trust her.  I get anxious every time she goes into work, wondering what else might be going on, hidden behind lies (mostly worried about cheating considering she works with mostly guys who are very attractive, even to me, a straight male).  She gets angry whenever I mention that I'm anxious or sad and thinks the trust should've came back just after two weeks.  I am not a perfect boyfriend by any means, but I always tell her the truth if I mess up.  
So am I the one at fault here? Because she really makes me feel like I am.",severe
"Long stream of depressed consciousness. I've been living with these thoughts all my life and I think they will be with me until I die. : I grew up in an extremely abusive household. I can't overemphasize that. My family were refugees and my grandfather in particular was a literal war criminal.
I grew up in a violent, horrifying home. I was terrified and deeply depressed. In school I could not smile and play. I made no friends. I was bullied until I became the quiet creepy kid who people left alone.
I never connected with anyone. I failed out of school and laid down in my room to die for years. But I never died. I'm still here. I've cleaned my life up a little. I have a job and I live in my own apartment.
I disowned my family. But I am deeply unhappy and negative. No medication or therapy changes that. And I've been taking meds and seeing therapists for 15 years now.
I am a miserable and unhappy person. Few people want to date me or by my friends, and those who do are toxic and deeply disturbed themselves.
I want to die. I have no hope that anything will change. I will continue to be alone and unhappy until I die.
I enjoy nothing. I don't enjoy TV or music. I play a lot of podcasts, but I don't really enjoy them either. Having people talk in the background sometimes keeps me from thinking as much. Less chance that I fall into a pit of depression and suicidal thought.
I don't even want to be happy. I want to end.
If I had a genie and I could wish for anything, I wouldn't wish for money or love or happiness. I would wish that I had never been born.
I've had thoughts like these my entire life. They don't go away. And when I look around me at the world it all seems justified. Climate deniers are in power. We're slowly marching toward preventable disaster. I can't convince myself that humanity is good and I'm wrong for being so negative.
I think maybe if more people were cynical they wouldn't have just said everything will be okay and let the world reach the state it is in now. Maybe a little cynicism is what humanity needed to steer a better course.
Above all, I feel it's too late. I think we're all doomed and I will live a sad, lonely life until my dog dies. Then I'll kill myself and the decades long misery will end forever.
Go ahead. Laugh and downvote away. I'm used to being ridiculed or threatened with hospitalization if I open up and express what I actually feel inside.
I think one day those people who laugh or treat me like I'm sick will have to face the reality that I am living through. I think when civilization comes apart at the seams and half the world is burning there are going to be more people like me than not.
I know this is repetitive and long. It's a stream of consciousness and it's been running on repeat in my mind since I woke up.",severe
"Recently started seeing a therapist : As the post says, I've started seeing a therapist for about a month now (seen her 2 times) I've been taking anti-depressants since July '19, but they stopped working in early September. I don't really remember them working really, but I've had some things happen from ALOT of family problems, getting in a fire, suffering horribly from anxiety at times paranoia and hallucinations (about once or twice every other day), depression, recently around the past 2-3 weeks I've been having panic attacks daily.. (3-4 a day but it can be up to 6 some days), when I sleep I never get rest as I wake up multiple times a night because i have breakouts from my Rhynauds, I sleep for around 17-18 hours on average, the past 4 or 5 months i have nightmares everytime I close my eyes so I'm scared to initially fall asleep.. so I just stay awake as long as possible until my brain just is like ""time to shut down now"".. I've lost 13ish pounds since October 31st, which makes me 122 pounds at an age of 19. I want to change myself, and my life but my feet are in so much pain I can't walk so much and doctors don't really have anything they can so for it. The biggest problem with depression I hate it how i have no emotions towards anything and when I do it's negitive. The holidays + January have been absolute hell. My mum canceled Christmas &amp; Thanksgiving and then put it back on just so my older sister doesn't find out how mentally ill she is. She's very bad off and takes medicine and she has been doing better this month but still has bad days, I have not.. a few weeks ago I woke up to hearing a gun shot like sound waking up in a panic thinking ""Oh my god, MOMMA!!"" I woke up to surprise she didn't do that.. but she did throw the table across the room, and was cutting herself, over dosing, and nearing the edge of actually killing herself. I'm constantly scared. I don't think I will kill myself only because i am to scared to fail, so.. I don't know where I'm going with this, I just want to stop living life with this ""grey filter"" and want to be the happy old me who did things besides leaving the house once every few months. I'm hoping this therapist helps. Thank you for reading if you've made it this far, have a great day.. :)",severe
"Money... : So, I just got a student loan and they originally told me that I’d be paid a monthly living allowance, which would be fine. That would be perfect because I could pay my bills and still have a little bit left over each month. I still haven’t been a paid a living allowance, and thus when I called them; they told me that I was given the WRONG information... and that it was all in a lump sum. So now, I’ve paid my bills... and according to them, $1,000 is enough to live on for 4 months at a time.

"Therapy : I have been having some adverse reactions towards my therapist lately. In December we took a break from our relationship because we both had things to do. When I came back I was really anxious. I had never been so anxious seeing her. I thought that the anxiety would go away but it always come back. Whether I call to schedule an appointment with her, think about my appointment with her the night before my appointment, or while waiting for my appointment in the lobby, during our sessions and after my anxiety ramps up. My last session with her my voice was shaking. She told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. 
I don’t really know where this is coming from. I was expecting the anxiety to go away by now. I become so anxious that others notice at work and that I become nauseous. Maybe it’s the fear that the relationship could work out or maybe it’s the fear that it won’t work out. 
I kind of just use her as a sounding board at the moment. It bothers me to my core that I have to pay someone just to listen to me because I have been quiet for too long. The things that she tells me are basic.  We have tried meditation but I had this fear that she was going to rob me. We tried book work but we both became distracted and now we don’t know where to start with that. We practice assertiveness and I’m doing okay with that. Sometimes I don’t think that I need her and that I’m wasting my money. Sometimes I think it would be better if I just said that it isn’t working out.",severe
"I feel depersonalizing again : # Triggers are marked as spoilers.
The moment emotions become too much, I feel like it's not my life anymore. And then it feels like I'm watching as a ghost experiencing what the body is doing. Those moments are the most dangerous because I can make decissions like ""This person needs some rest"" and I go for a walk for hours, lose the way, getting hypothermia. I somehow feel the cold but ""it's not me"" so I keep on walking. Or I space out and I'm staring for hours. &gt;!Or I do automatic things like cutting. I don't exacly choose to do it, it just happens. And at that moment I can easily do something to myself 'cuz !&lt;I don't feel any love or sadness for what I do to my family.

"So uh, orgasms cure my apathy : Before you ask, no, I haven't talked to my therapist about this yet.
About myself - I'm female, in my twenties, diagnosed with depression six years ago, it's been getting worse. Past two years I struggled mostly with the lack of emotion. Thanks (?) to antidepressants, I don't get horny a lot, but orgasms feel nice so I'm getting myself off on occasion. It's really efficient against headaches, too, you know.
But what puzzles me is that sometimes during actual climax and just for a second or two, I feel whole. Like I'm back in my body and everything is solid and real. It's hard to describe. The fog is gone, I'm in control again.
Has anyone experienced something similar? Is there any sort of physical explanation for this? I'm fairly uncomfortable taking about this IRL so y'all are my last resort. Don't let me down.",severe
"Wanna know something funny? : When I was 15 I tried to take my life by overdosing on Prozac. (To be ironic I guess, and because it was the least painful method I had access to). Long story short, it didn't work. I didn't even have to get my stomach pumped, or drink charcoal, which made me feel like a big fucking moron. The way I was treated at the hospital was absolutely atrocious. I won't even get into it, but let's just say I finally realized and understood just how little I matter to the world. 
Two years later, and I still believed that I suffered no permanent injuries or whatever from my attempt. But this past New Year's Eve, my mother let my sister drink a glass of champagne (she's 20). I asked her if I could have one as well and she said no. She then proceeded to tell me that my suicide attempt fucked up my liver so bad that drinking was out of the question for me. It makes sense, considering my recent blood test results have weird, usually concerning results on them that my doctor ignored, as she knows about my attempt. 
I am so fucking pissed off. You're telling me that I can't even drink to forget or I'll die from liver failure? (Which is not something I'm trying to do. It sounds long and painful). Fuck this dude. Fuck this. I'm literally laughing right now. What in the actual goddamn fuck?",severe
"Getting off of antidepressants? : I was on lexapro for 2 years due to depression and it worked for a long time. But now, I’m not depressed anymore and recently lexapro has just made it hard for me to think straight and given me a drunk feeling. I tried to quit cold turkey, which was probably stupid. I went about a week and a half without it which felt like an eternity because the withdrawal symptoms were horrible. 
I was throwing up everyday, my heart was racing, I was lightheaded, my mouth was extremely dry, I had flu like symptoms etc. 
weirdly despite all of this though, I felt a lot better mentally off of it.
Eventually it became unbearable so now I’m on a low dose of prozac and not having withdrawals anymore. The thing is, prozac gives me the same unmotivated, drunk feeling as lexapro and I don’t want to be on either.
I’m taking 10mg prozac right now and don’t know how to go about getting off of it or tapering.
Does anyone have any advice or personal experience? anything is appreciated lol

I didn't think I was stressed or anxious at all but I think I just didn't know what it felt like to not be, but this drug has taken away so much pain from me. I just took my first pill today and I immediately felt like I can finally stop thinking and worrying about 10 things at once all day every day and when I'm trying to sleep. Its like my head is so much slower, calmer, and quieter and its so nice. I haven't felt this close to being better since I first started suffering.

"A bad day? A depressive episode? An overreaction? I don't know anymore. : First I would like to say I'm currently diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety, and since 2016 I am taking 30mg of Lexapro (generic). 
So, a friend and I had been watching a TV show together and last week we watched the final episode. The show itself was dark and emotional, and the last episode was especially emotional because it implied that the main characters had died (they didn't). I felt a bit off afterwards but I just thought it was a normal reaction to finishing a show I liked.
The next day I woke up feeling okay-ish, but as the day went on, I became more and more upset and distressed. I started obsessing over the TV show thinking ""What if they really died?"" and I couldn't stop fixating on it, even though there was proof I was wrong. And even though there was positive things to think about that happened in the show, I didn't care about them, I just focused on everything negative. I began to lose interest in things, things I liked to do or anything else. I didn't want to listen to music, I didn't want to play games or watch videos. I didn't feel like smiling or laughing. I didn't want to eat or drink anything. Everything felt like too much effort. Sometimes I would just stare at the wall and cry because I felt so hopeless. I didn't want to do anything but lay in bed and agonize and obsess over that stupid TV show, my brain just pumping out sad or upsetting ""what if, what if, what if"" questions. This lasted for 4-5 days. 
I felt so stupid and dumb, like ""Why are you this upset over something like this?"". I felt stupid going to the doctor and talking to my therapist about it. My therapist suggested that maybe I've had a build up of stress over the past months and the TV show was what triggered it, and I asked ""Well if that's the case, then why did I just focus and obsess so much on the TV show and nothing else? Why not on the other things in my life?"" and she didn't know. My therapist and mom would say things like ""Well it didn't last that long this time"" and ""Even on medication you'll still have down days"" and I'm just confused and frustrated. So, that's all it is? Was what I went through just a bad day? Is that normal? I have to go through something like that again? I can't watch a damn TV show I like in case something like this happens again?
It didn't feel like a normal reaction, I felt horrible, I didn't feel like myself. But still I wonder if I'm just overreacting about this whole thing. I hadn't had a bad episode in a long time, and I do have a tendency to get obsessed with things that I like. Maybe it wasn't depression, maybe I'm just a sensitive person, maybe this is just something I have to deal with and get used to. I'm just really scared, I don't want to go through that again, and I'm scared that there's nothing that can help me or prevent this from happening again.",severe

"Tragedy of depression and unknown psychologically „diseases“ : Hey reddit users 
I‘m writing this, because I know that my time in this world will be over soon. I never really had a good binding to this world so that‘s why it won‘t be hard for me to do it, at least that‘s what I‘m hoping. I‘m a 19 year old guy from germany (don’t judge my english please) living in a time where society has two sides for people. One side is basically bad and the other cares. But this really depends on who you are. I‘m not writing this text to get attention, because why would I need attention If I die anyway? I know that society depends on experience but one side that reads this will think excactly what I said and the other might care about it. The inaquality of people is what makes this world such a bad place. I tried many years to find my way through it and through what I am. One of those things is that I know what empathy is but I can’t feel it. Like many “Psychologically“ kids I was send to psychiastry some years ago by my parents but only had to stay there three weeks. I noticed soon that I don’t get the help I need and the only thing I got was medicine I didn’t want. I was in one of these rooms next to the big eating table under investigation for the reasons I was send there. The door was locked the whole day and I only got out to eat what I hated. Every evening I layed my head on the table in my room and begged my parents to get me out but they didnt. I don’t like society that much. Why do I need to confront social anxiety when I only want the pain to be gone. What‘s paradox is that I would consider myself a good friend, because I always care for my friends problems even though I don’t like people. It‘s just the experience I got with them. I don’t have the kind of friends I can talk to. Otherwise I won‘t write this but I want to know what I have before I go. It feels like being hated by a god you don’t believe in. I always believed in the devil even If there can‘t be one without the other. I wish I could be independent from society or have someone on my side of view to help me out to bloom. Or just give me the ability to wear another mask the whole day so I can hide my difference better so I don’t have to do this. I don’t have a fixed date yet, because at the moment (since 1/2 year) I found someone similar to me. The big problem is I‘m not able to talk to her, because she’s introverted. I tried at the beginning but she didn’t even respond to my text message when I introduced her to the chat of our class group. I kinda feel responsable for her, because I like her much even though I don’t know her well. But she‘s a perfect example for what else can happen to you. While others hate her because of her kind I want the best for her and I think the best for her will be me, leaving her alone. She‘s the one kind of hope I have in life. I think that everything is easier together. But not together like a group. I mean together like a binding between two persons. Call it love or how you want but I call it hope. But she also came with a negative side like the fact that she leaves our school now. Since I know her I feel even worser than before. At night I stay awake even longer to think and my pain got worse to a degree where it‘s untenable. My mind even created a eating disease for me. I never ate much but now I have this pain everytime I ate something and after I have to go to the toilet and my body just doesn’t accept me to concentrate in school or to eat which is one reason I hate to eat with others. It feels like my body already accepted to be turned off soon. To the kind of people I try to call friends I said that I have a eating disease and a scar in my stomach which I will die from. This should make it easier for me to go. Well I didn’t tell everyone of my friends. I guess I can say that I have around 3/4 „ok“ friends and I told three of them. With this text I want to get something to say in this cruel world too. I want to know what I have and I want to thank the girl I was talking about for giving me the ability to stay a bit longer. Also there is a girl on Instagram I really really like. But only as a person. Her name is Dasha Taran. I like the way she lives her life. When you look at her you get a comfortable feeling, like listening to one of Billie Eilish‘s or Eden‘s songs. The best thing about her is that she doesn’t show pictures like most of the girls do nowadays. She doesn’t need to show her whole body like others do and on her pictures she smiles you straight in the face. Thats something you don’t see often nowadays. There is too much fake out there. Is it a fake smile you have to put on for others or a fake life you life to impress others. The last of my days I will try to find an answer for my problem either in form of sleeping pills or a person I can talk to about everything I want to, because I left many things out. Tomorrow will be the first day in school while knowing that the girl left school and I got no hope anymore. She basically was the only reason I enjoyed going to school. At least it‘s better than at home.

"Watching myself die : I know there are things I need to do and avoiding them or running away is just making it worse but I feel paralyzed. Like I’m essentially out of body and watching myself being murdered or lit on fire from all the bad choices or lack there of. I know I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and the only way to change is to break this cycle but I feel stuck. I’ve been in different medications which is a struggle to find what works right now I have very little energy and my therapist that i have been seeing recently only gives me these modules on self esteem and anxiety and Just listens to me to talk for an hour and I don’t see how that’s supposed to help. I have missed a lot of my classes and midterms because I just feel so mentally and physically drained. How am i supposed to make up for all the missed work. My professors are understanding and all but I’m scared. I just don’t know what to do, it feels all so impossible right now. All I do is work and sleep, when I get home sometimes I just stare at the wall, I feel so numb to everything and I find it easier to worry and care for others than myself. I don’t know how to shake how I’m feeling. Before I was on keto lost 30 pounds and exercised and that did make me feel better but then I got disappointing news and I guess that tilted me and I gained all or more of that weight back and I just feel so gross about myself.",severe
"🌼TW🌼 Self Harm Mention : Hey... So.. I'm just posting this to let out stuff rn. Things have been rocky since switching around medication (for the FOURTH) time and I started new birth control so that's really not helping the depression. And as of lately idk why but with all the stress and nasty feelings I've been more depressed and it flares up abandonment issues. Yes I've gone to therapy, I have my next appointment the 28th and I'm going to a psych March 9. Sometimes I ask myself if I can last that long to even be able to sit down and be able to even start getting more of the help I need because I just wanna cave. It's not like my life is horrible either... I have an amaZing boyfriend that I know I'll spend the rest of my life with. I'm in college and yeah it's hard but at least I'm here. I'm in a sorority. I have a job at my university too. But it's just not enough to have like an okay life and be just okay. I haven't been near just okay in a couple weeks. 
I've relapsed and self harmed multiple times within the past couple days and I feel the urge again. It gets worse anytime those little abandonment issues come up. Do I wanna get into detail? Not really. All I will say is due to circumstances in life I will sometimes get these episodes of dread (gotta love the GAD/Panic Disorder too!!!) and feel like everyone's gonna leave. Like my boyfriend will leave like the others did even though he has given me NO reason whatsoever. The opposing, actually... He left for work and those feelings hit me and I lost it and I'm typing this so I can keep my hands busy and not actually relapse more. I wanna do it so bad. The pain gives me that sense of control; I can't control when someone goes away forever (this is my brain during all the big stuff oh boy) but I can control the fact that I can inflict pain on myself or choose not to. I end up wanting to more than anything. 
I can't help but feel irrationally alone and it makes me even more depressed... Also I'm sorry that this may not make sense. My head's everywhere I'm everywhere right now. I just hate how this is all a freaking endless loop too. 
Thanks for sitting through this if you did 💜 Blessed be 💙",severe
"February 22nd 2020 : I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I’m not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must’ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don’t think this will be the last time I do this. I just don’t feel much except weariness anymore and I’m tired. To anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance, thank you for being there for me :)",severe
"(23F) Separated from husband with 50/50 custody of 2 year old : I suffered pretty bad from PPD after having my son. It didn’t help that my husband was toxic and had his own problems. Now we’re on better terms but separated and he’s paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it’s awesome. But 95% of the time it’s me and half of the week it’s my son and I. I’ve been eating right and exercising daily for the past month and a half, feeling so good about myself. Yesterday I got my son back and was so happy. I meal prepped in the kitchen with fun music while simultaneously playing with my kiddo. A really amazing day. Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that’s wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he’s here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I’ll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can’t do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven’t done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn’t fully furnished. I type that and think I’m just lazy. But holy hell, I took my son to the museum today and that was the biggest feat I think I’ve ever pulled. Just making that move to get out of bed, get myself dressed, get him dressed, leave the house... now I feel so heavy. My head actually feels pressure pushing me down. I don’t want to do anything. I had a three day streak where I didn’t brush my teeth or my hair, and that’s still while dieting and exercising. I think I am always depressed, but on some days I can do more things than others and distract myself. 
Anyway. Meeting my STB ex tonight with my stepkids for a show. Another thing that I have to force myself to do without thinking of vomiting.",severe
"So scared for my first therapy appointment today :( : I will try to make this short... I am a long time lurker of this sub but haven't posted before.
I have struggled with chronic depression/anxiety since childhood and have been in therapy off and on over the many years. I have trouble maintaining relationships, leaving the house, and have not been able to hold a job more than 3 months in quite some time. I do have a loving, supportive partner. These past few months have been significantly worse. I have had suicidal thoughts, have been self harming with greater intensity, and need help with basic tasks because I have no energy/motivation despite sleeping all day. I have pretty intense panic attacks. 
Sometimes I feel like there are two different Mes... the me who wants to die, pull my hair out, make myself bleed, and can't control my extreme emotions. Then there is the regular me, who can type out this post and even go on walks outside with the encouragement of my partner, and look at the water and think about how beautiful the world can be.
Anyway... I am in a new country and have restarted a new medication. I also start with a new therapist today. I am so scared. What if they think I am faking it? What if they laugh? What if they say they can't help me? Or, I saw a crime documentary on a crazy therapist who blackmailed her patients to commit crimes. What if my therapist is crazy?
Looking for encouragement or advice from people who understand my situation. My partner is going to the appointment, and he waits in the lobby, so I will have that support.",severe
"Life is a biiiittttcchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh : A few years ago, nothing in the world could make me cry. And even though I was depressed, I could still handle it. I had control over my emotions. 
Now I’m also on birth control (for health reasons) and my depression either makes me feel “normal” some days or it just makes me want to ignore everyone and disappear. I’m always SOOOOO moody. The moody part is a hell lot worse when I do get on my period. I become extremely emotional for NO reason. 
The littlest things make me cry. I talked to my doctor about it and she said that it’s normal. That they’re just side effects and it’s different for everyone. The two medications make it worse because antidepressants are meant to help me fight depression, but birth control’s side effect IS depression. I’ve been on it for a year now and I don’t know if it’s worth taking it anymore. Maybe my irregular periods aren’t meant to be like everyone else’s. Maybe it’d be better if I just bled twice a month every month. Like I can’t believe I have to be on antidepressants and BC for the rest of my life. That’s so disappointing and frustrating. I can’t believe I have to depend on some fucking pills to even be happy for a moment. 
Recently if things don’t go according to plans, gives me major anxiety attacks or it just really really really makes me want to shut off. 
I’m just soooooooooooo fucking frustrated. I don’t want to talk to anyone anymore. I wish I had no one in my life so I could easily go somewhere and die maybe. But I have so much to live for at the same time. I don’t know who I am anymore. My mind is EVERYFUCKINGWHERE. Even if I wanted to die I couldn’t do it cuz I’m a coward and physical pain scares me 🤬",severe
"opening up, but not really. : I (F19) only recently found a group of people I feel like I can trust completely, and a couple of days ago, I opened up to those people about how I've been struggling with my mental health. I've had issues with my mental health for about four years, but have only been diagnosed for the past two. I don't like to talk about this with people because I'm just so afraid to lose the friends i have. I don't go into detail with anyone unless they ask questions, because I don't want to overshare or make them feel like they have to fix anything. I basically just said *""The reason \[redacted\] happened is because I'm dealing with depression, and I'm trying to deal with it as best as i can"".* 
I don't really know what I expected to happen. They took it surprisingly well, though, saying things along the lines of  *""I'm glad you told me""* and *""Let me know if you need anything"".* I don't feel like I deserve their kindness. I have never experienced this before (people wanting to help &amp; be there for me) and I don't feel like I deserve it. I don't know if I'll ever be able to fully open up (or if i even should) because I feel like the more I say the more they'll push me away, and I don't want that to happen. 
I have been hurt by so many people, parents included, that I don't even know if I can trust them. I put so much value into my friends because my relationship with my parents hasn't always been the best. I love them to death and I would do anything for them. The fact that I am afraid to trust them completely is not because of anything they have done. I honestly **do** believe they are telling the truth. It's just me, remembering how people have lied to me before. I just don't want that to happen again.
My depression and anxiety has been getting worse lately, which is the only reason I told anyone in the first place. I feel like I can't get through this by myself, but I also feel completely unlovable and like a burden on anyone that I tell. I don't know if people would still be friends with me if I completely opened up and told them what I'm dealing with. I am trying to get therapy at my college's health center, so I guess that's good. 
I still feel completely alone, though. I hate how I am, because I want to be able to be the best friend I can be to these people. But right now I'm just drained and overwhelmed. I feel like I need to talk to someone but I don't want to ruin a friendship, so I think I'll just keep it bottled up for now, and only cry when my roommate leaves the room.",severe

"I’m like a shark some days : I was doing well the past few weeks. The best I’ve been in the last five years. 
Saw a doctor. Got diagnosed. ADHD and depression. 
Started taking meds. And keeping my room clean. And cooking. And spending time with my family. 
I remember a few days ago thinking, “I can finally feel it. I can finally see why people want to live.” It welled up in my chest like flowers blooming. 
But Sunday was a bad day, someone said something about people wanting to die and I closed my eyes and all I could see was me, dying, over and over dying, graphic images I didn’t want to see, more vivid than they’ve ever been. Always trauma to the head or neck, a dozen different ways, explosions and tears and slices and strangulation and so much. Just so much. Cycling. 
I couldn’t open my eyes for a minute. I couldn’t open my eyes and for a few seconds it felt good, and then something shifted and it hurt so bad. My throat hurt and my eyes burned and tears came that I did my best to hide. I was with people, I was with so many people, and I had to stay with them for hours. 
Images blurred inside my eyes. Every time I closed them the pictures were there. I died a thousand deaths and kept conversation flowing through my lips while I drowned in them. Even when I couldn’t see anything anymore apart from my head being crushed, ripped from my shoulders, blown up from the inside out. 
I waded through the rest of the day with a scream in my throat, a half step away from a panic attack, smiling for an audience I didn’t want to lie to. 
Sunday. 
They’re still here. It’s hard to tell whether they’re with me or I’m with them. I can make them go away for a bit, if I’m going and going with loud music in my ears and fully encompassing tasks in my hands and eyes and feet. I’ve listened to a lot of ACDC. I’ve gone grocery shopping and made meals for the week and cleaned three rooms of my house. 
The second I take a break, I try to take a breath, my throat starts to close up and my eyes tingle and they crawl through my skull from my ears, forward and back and up and down and everywhere, they’re everywhere. I have no space to run from them because they’ve found every corner of my mind and painted it. 
Can’t stop moving.",severe
"Am I having a psychotic break? : I’ve just had the worst episode I think I’ve ever had. I found out my whole in law family was plotting to get me out the house and replaced with my boyfriend of 1 year co-worker.
I am usually a timid person but I have destroyed the room, cut my legs and wrists up to hell and back (self harm) and cried for probably 3 days. My heart rate is so fast that I’ve just begun to ignore it, it feels like a 3 day long anxiety attack, I’ve almost hung myself and I cussed out my mother in law (I’ve never cussed at anyone over 25) and I am having unending suicidal thoughts like they’re just background noise now.
The scariest part is I’ve been hearing voices, yes voices, not thoughts. Once telling me to die and when I think the voices won’t let me finish my sentences without fucking up the sentence. Like I want to go to the (store) but instead I’ll hear barn or something like that. Also, the room was spinning a lot but since has stopped. 
I was already severely suicidal and depressed but this rage is unmanageable, I have a bad temper but never am so upfront with it. I fear I’m having a schizophrenic break, my abusive dad before we got away from him was a paranoid of some kind. Not sure what kind. 
Does this sound like a psychotic break.",severe

"I need help. I don't know if I should kill myself or tough it out until I die naturally. : I've attempted suicide 5 times in the past. Ranging from overdosing to drowning. Each time I try someone finds me and I am brought back to this joke of a life. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to suffer. I've gotten help and I've tried to do all the coping skills that have been given to me. Nothing helps anymore. I don't know what to do.

My family is incredibly toxic, my friends grow more distant by the day as I isolate myself. Socially I've become a nightmare, trying to focus in conversation, or even to keep my head up takes a ridiculous amount of energy. I'm too young and broke to get drunk or high, or even run away for a while, so I've resorted to self harm again, but nothing takes the edge off of the cutting hollow emptiness I feel at all times. I find myself disassociating, watching myself do actions, speak, but feel a constant sense of dread. I feel a hand over my mouth, keeping me from speaking the truth, of how alone and lost I feel, how nothing anyone says or does, even those I've spent time building personal relationships helps.

"Agomelatine Sexual Side Effects : Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this, but I am a little lost trying to find information and would appreciate any help people can give. 
Hiya, so I have been diagnosed with OCD/anxiety, and I also suffer from mild-moderate depression. I have been discussing antidepressants with my GP, and I am considering asking for agomelatine/valdoxan. My main concerns with medication are: no sexual side effects, and no extensive tapering needed when stopping the medication. I have tried mirtazapine but found the zombie like foggy feelings too much to tolerate, and I am in the UK so Wellbutrin is not an option.  
Agomelatine seems to fit my criteria, but I have come across a couple of anecdotes about sexual side effects developing after a longer period of time on this medication, and I wanted to ask if anyone could give me more information/any more anecdotes regarding sexual side effects of this drug. I know it is generally considered to have very few sexual side effects, especially compared to other antidepressants, but I want to understand if this means essentially no potential for such side effects, or just a very low incidence.
Furthermore, I am aware that sexual dysfunction can persist after stopping medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs. Does anyone know if there is a similar risk with agomelatine? Sexual dysfunction is something I have struggled with in the past, and I am absolutely unwilling to risk potentially permanent side effects, so I want to be aware before discussing with my doctor since he is not overly informed about the exact side effects of particular psychiatric medications.

Depression, anxiety, and even symptoms of CFS, which Celexa might have been fighting the whole time.

We tried Effexor for the next couple months, but it seems to not be doing anything and my neurologist wants to get me off of it. He suggested either getting back on Celexa but going much slower, or using Prozac.

1. Will Celexa be more likely to work for me again if it worked previously really well and we go up much slower to reduce side effects?

"I'm tired of hearing ""it gets better"" over and over and over. It doesn't. It gets worse. : I'm tired of hearing this sentiment from well-meaning, but naive people.  I get that they're trying to help, but the words fall flat in the face of actual experience.
I've been grappling with MDD for most of my life.  Every damn day has been an uphill battle with no real payoff.  From the moment I wake up to the moment I hit the bed, my mind is filled with ""I want to die.  I wish to no longer exist.""
I've tried meds.
I've tried therapy, both one-on-one and group.
I've tried experimental stuff like ECT and Ketamine infusions.
I've tried exercise and eating better.
I've spent time in psych wards.
Not a single damn thing has changed the fact that I'd rather be dead than alive.  And as the years go by the feeling has only intensified.
Maybe, for some people, it gets better.  Good for them.  But for a lot of people it doesn't.  I wish more people understood that one person's experience with depression isn't the same as everyone else's.",severe
"Anyone else fucking hate being dependent on medication? : It works and as a result of it I'm able to function normally so I feel like I shouldn't complain, but still I hate the fact that I have to take it. It's not even that if I forget to take a dose I'll feel like shit all day.
It's the feeling that now I'm completely at the mercy of the pharmaceutical industry and the next Martin Shkreli type of scumbag can decide to raise the price astronomically at any moment just because he feels like it. I feel like I have to be thankful to some piece of shit pharmaceutical company execs just for not deciding to bankrupt people like us.
Also that if there is a significant disruption in the modern supply chain that all industrialized places rely on, tough shit! Time to go cold turkey! I know that depression isn't an actual illness that can kill you by itself so it's not the best comparison, but the reason so many people in Puerto Rico died from Hurricane Maria wasn't because of drowning or being crushed by rubble, it was because they ran out of their medication or power for the devices that kept them alive.
I hate that I need meds to function. It makes me feel pathetic and dependent on a system that I hate with every fiber of my being. And I hate knowing that had I been born in literally any other era or even most places in the world today I'd be dead by now.
Anyone else feel similarly?",severe
"I've been on this earth for 18 years and I want out. : I've been through a lot and nothing really helps me anymore. My depression meds keep me from feeling sad, but they also make my shitshow of a life more apparent to me. My closest friends keep leaving me because I'm too much when I'm at my worst. I've been trying to get better but I keep relapsing. Bad things keep happening to me one after the other, and I can't take it anymore. I've weighed my options carefully and I think the best thing I can do for the few people that still care about me is to die. They shouldn't have to deal with my breakdowns or my suicidal moments. They shouldn't have to worry about me killing myself anymore. Once I'm dead, they can all move on with their lives without having to worry about me anymore. In my eyes, my death is me showing them mercy. I'll be doing them a favor.",severe
Concentration after Wellbutrin : I was prescribed a low dose of 100mg Wellbutrin SR twice a day. I am on week two and I feel like my concentration has gone downhill. I'm sitting here at work halfway through the day and I haven't done anything. I felt like I was quite productive before the Wellbutrin. Do any of you have the same experience?,severe
"Don’t Know What to Do Anymore : Meds haven’t worked, therapy has been a waste of time. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I don’t feel sad, but simply just nothing. Complete apathy. 
I’ve lost all interest in everything, and am at the point in my life where I need to go to college or work. My grades in high school are bad so my options are limited, plus I don’t have any passions to follow. 
As for work, I’m the opposite of fit, and every job I can find that doesn’t require secondary education or people skills (yay severe social anxiety) are labor jobs like construction.
I feel like I’m just infinitely stuck, in a world where if you’re not charismatic and happy you’re fucked.
I don’t know what to do anymore and just want it all to end. Not necessarily through suicide, I just want it all to stop.",severe
"Not sure wether to take it or not (Overdose) : I'm currently sitting on my bed with 6 pills of 5mg tranxene in my hand... the amount my doctor told me take was only 5mg based on not enough evidence.. but that didn't seem to help.. so i did my own research  and found out that the maximum safe amount i should take in one dose is 15mg... 
I have been going against the doctors orders and taking those pills constantly... now I'm sitting here with 30mg of those pills in my hand even considering to take more... and I'm unsure if 30mg is fatal or not.. or if i really want to overdose... i am afraid yet I'm also very much tempted.. i just want the constant pain to stop.. i want to be at peace..",severe
"Feel like failure not sure how long I can keep going : I withdrew from college several years ago because I had severe social anxiety. I was a great student in high school. I took AP classes, and everyone thought I would be a doctor. I keep working dead end jobs.l want to go back, but I owe the school money. Every time I have money saved something comes up. I don’t know who to ask for help. My parents can hardly afford to live. I feel like my life is worthless. I’m not sure who to turn to. I’m 25, and I see my peers traveling and getting married. I have nothing.",severe
"I was doing so good, now today I wish I were dead. : I have been working on my mental health diligently since I had a mental breakdown at work 3 months ago. I have been in therapy, I have been on Prozac and have been meeting with a psychiatrist monthly. I just got promoted at my job after only being there for 6 months.
None of that means anything to me if the person I love hates me and thinks I am pathetic. People at work think I've been screwing management to get my promotion. I have a target on my back and for no reason other than I'm trying to improve my life.
I've made a fair share of mistakes. My SO is beyond done with me because I lied about smoking cigarettes. Before my mental health was under control, I'd smoke every now and again, knowing he didn't like it. I was selfish and only think about myself and what makes me feel better. He is right, I am pathetic.
Nobody at my job respects me anymore. Nobody looks at me the same way since I was promoted. I wanted to be the department trainer because of my previous experience, my hardworking nature, and my care for people and their mental health in the workplace. Nobody will get my name out of their mouth. My SO works in the same building as me and my life is far beyond damaged by all of this.
I am neck deep in debts that I will never be able to pay, due to my last relationship ending from abuse and me escaping with no money to my name. I am fucked. I am beyond fucked. I have ruined my whole life and I've also ruined the lives of everyone around me.
It's hard to believe that there is anything to live for. I am hopeless.",severe
"What is wrong with me? : Do you ever just lie there wondering what is actually wrong with yourself. it’s like a feeling you get inside, you can’t explain it, you can’t articulate it but something just isn’t right. You feel wrong. You don’t know how to fix yourself. No matter what medication i’ve taken or amount of therapy i’ve had the feeling of feeling wrong just won’t go away. Its gnawing away at me",severe
My medicine is making me go crazy. : I have been on Zoloft and abilify for a while. I stoped taking it but started again Monday. For one it makes me extremely tired. My thoughts in my head are like pounding my skull. I don’t know how to describe it.,severe
"My entire life is falling apart due to the coronavirus. : I have diagnosed depression and am on the autism spectrum. As a result the little social interaction I do have is incredibly important and bordering on life saving to me: conferences, board game nights, public events, the few parties I am invited to. When they are present, I’m not happy exactly, but happier. When they are gone, I don’t see much of a point in living.
However, of course, much of that has either been canceled, or is the kind of thing people are saying don’t do for public health reasons, and this seems likely to go on for months, if not longer. (I’m in one of the cities with a lot of cases, and the governor has banned large gatherings already.) So now I have nothing and no one.
The thought of being forced to not leave the house is devastating. The thought of those social events not returning is even more devastating, let alone the long term repercussions to my future career (layoffs have started; conferences are the reasons it exists.) The thought of what happens if I do get sick is devastating both for the normal reasons and because I am never lonelier than when I am sick by myself, with no one to check on me or invested in my life. And I honestly don’t think it is catastrophizing. If anything events are worse than I anticipated.
Basically, it feels like I have been consigned to a joyless life for an indefinite period of time, with serious moral consequences if I go against it, and I don’t know what to do. (I do not have a plan or anything, but I have more than once had the morbid thought that I can’t commit suicide because a dead body is a public health risk.) I was already short on reasons to think the future will be brighter; now I cannot see any at all.",severe
"Prozac Dreams : I've searched in the sub and seen that other people have experienced this, but it doesn't seem like there's an answer on how to address.  I've been on 20mg of prozac for almost two years now, and on and off it's given me super vivid dreams. 
It's been worse the past few weeks / months though.  I have super vivid dreams, some of which are really upsetting.  It's not just that I remember them super well, they're actually hard to forget.  It might be because my job is really dull and repetitive right now, I spend all day staring at a screen doing kind of mindless things, but I keep randomly remembering moments from dreams I had a week ago, or days ago, and feeling haunted.  And then each night I have new dreams that will haunt me for weeks.  It's weird.  I'm more venting than anything else - it seems like there's not really an answer.",severe
"Insomnia +phenergan : Recently I’ve been unmedicated for depression, and honestly I think it is better for me than previously on SSRIs.
However I am again experiencing severe sleep problems, I frequently go the whole night without sleep.
I have been given 50mg to take before bed, but despite making me feel drowsy, I still find my mind fully awake and struggling to sleep.
Any suggestions/ advice??

"How do I cope with Impostor Syndrome and make friends? : So I am a Freshman in college and graduated in June 2019 from High School. I was clinically diagnosed with depression during my senior year of High School. My friend group has started to go its own ways no matter how hard I try to meet up with my friends it doesn't really seem like they meet me effort wise. Its always been difficult for me to make friends outside of the people I grew up with. I always have this self critical inside voice during social interactions with anyone im not comfortable with. Usually ultra analyzing my own behavior and trying to do the ""right"" things. Its awful and it really prevents me from making friends I feel like. So its been months and I have no friends, haven't had a girlfriend since graduation and im just lonely and sad all the time. Every now and then I think about suicide but I just dont have the guts to do it. I have this feeling that because of that Im not really depressed because If I was I would be able to kill myself. Like im just somebody who cant handle the real world. The self hate is real. Any advice on how to change my thought process, and be more comfortable with myself so that I can really begin to make new friends. If its even possible to fix this.",severe
"I'm getting dumber and dumber : 2 years since this fucking none sense started, I just can't think straight, every day laying down, thinking about nothing, watching the time passing by, wanting to die, but not really... Just thinking about dissappearing without leaving a track, having mental breakdowns, lying about every fucking aspect in my life, lying to my family, friends, people. I can't even open myself to my own mother because i'm a fake piece of SHIT. I got this feeling that i'm fucking devolving, I can feel and see myself devolving, turning into a wall. Please someone let me know if you feel the same way",severe
"Is there anyone who can relate to my symptoms? : I have been diagnosed with depression and anixety for 9 years but I'm not even sure at this point that it's the correct diagnosis. None of my treatments have worked, SSRIs made me worse and SNRIs only fixed minor symptoms like mood. Therapy and CBT do not work. And I feel so alone because the more I try and reach out, or find information about what I'm going through online, the more I realise that I'm alone in this.
I cannot get out of bed, and barely eat. I have not lost motivation or ambition, but it's like I'm physically trapped in my body. My attention span and memory are terrible, I can barely remember what I did yesterday. I feel anxiety constantly, even when I'm doing nothing or trying to relax. I can't keep a routine or care for myself because I feel I cannot physically move anymore. I get hypersomnia and at worst I can sleep for up to 24 hours, but my average is usually about 12. My mind races and the only time I ever feel normal is when I manage to distract myself and literally forget about reality. And I get this really weird feeling that never disappears, it feels like a physical pain that's numb. Like, imagine your arm is numb and then you pinch it really hard. You can tell that your arm is having a sensation of pain, but without the actual pain being felt. It's like that for me everyday. I am just trapped in this bed slowly starving.
The only conditions I have ever managed to find that might explain this are catatonic depression and/or psychomotor retardation. But it is so hard for me to find information online about these, and my doctors and therapist do not discuss it with me much. I know I should really fight for them to discuss it with me but I'm so anxious when I get there that I let them walk over me.
Please, is there anyone out there who feels the same symptoms as I do? I just don't want to be alone, I want to strong and know that I can get better.",severe

"Hahahaha. I might never get to see my senior theatre friends again. : I have social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and depression, and I use a wheelchair. (Important for later.)
School closed—online classes only thru the rest of the semester—due to Coronavirus. As of today. (Plan as of yesterday was to come back Apr. 6. Then, shortly after that letter from the University President, the POTUS announced his travel ban and the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the plan to return was cancelled—commencement might still happen, but the semester is gonna be all online.)
This has hit the performing arts—theatre, dance, music—department(s) disproportionally hard. My head is spinning still. I’m nauseous—still. The dorms were going to remain open (I was going to come back by Apr. 6 for sure), but now, everyone has to return from Spring Break, effectively rushing the campus (which is also horrible for disease control) and clean out our lives. We have until March 23 to get out of the dorms. I’m tearing down my life and packing it into boxes tomorrow.
And... This year, I had finally overcome a huge trauma I dealt with years ago, where I had a falling out with some folks I was very close with for a long time. The last time I saw them, I had no idea it would be the last time. That trauma’s at the root of so many things I struggle with. Then, today, as I read that letter and started shaking, crying, screaming... I’m a junior, and that whole swath of seniors—I may never get to see them again. Friends, crushes, what have you... People I loved (love—fuck, it’s happening already), so, so much.
“No, no, no,” I said. “I can’t do it again, I can’t do this again.”
I’ll probably be working/writing thru this for a long time. A lot of other students—the seniors, and performing arts seniors, especially; those affected by COVID-19 personally; and those for whom it’ll be very hard to get home—are being hit harder than I am. 
But I finally found my theatre family this year. This semester started with a serious, serious injury for me, but this week has still been the craziest (sorry, I hate that word, but I can’t think of a better one right now) week of the semester. My heart is breaking. And I feel like I’m back to square one (or at least, it feels like I’ve lost so much progress).

Example
• I got into my dream school but withdrew because I got diagnosed with epilepsy the day before going. Every since I’ve been on multiple medications known to cause depression (currently on Klonopin and Briviact daily) Only a hand full of medications work for my type and they all cause depression.
• I got a car in 2018 and haven’t driven it because I keep having seizures right before I get cleared to drive again
• My SO and I opened a restaurant but he works all day everyday and I only see him at work where we constantly rub against each other. It seems he could live with or without me and either way he’d be fine. I feel so emotionally distant from him but our relationship feels like it comes 2nd to the business.
• I genuinely have no friends. Like absolutely nobody outside of my immediate family or SO. I cannot recall the last time I hung out with a friend. It’s got to be at least 4 or 5 years ago...
I just feel stagnant... my life feels like a blur. I’ve had anxiety since 6th grade. Everyday I get anxiety episodes (like a cold rush, an out or body euphoria, sinking feeling etc) and it’s become so normal to me, nobody knows...it happens. I just don’t say anything. Yet I have great things in my life, but this sadness feels like it’s covering my eyes to al of that. Right now I feel dead and worthless inside. When I tried to tell my SO that I don’t feel very important to him he says I treat him like crap but it’s fine and made it all about my faults... I feel like a piece of garbage.",severe
Medication carousel : I constantly have the urge to change my medication. I've had so many combinations that I forgot which one was best for me. They all have had side effects or made me feel dead inside. I'd like to withdraw completely but I feel so bad trying. I'm afraid the medication has changed who I am and I can never go back.,severe
"I can feel happiness? : I (22F) have spent the last 8 years of my life with intense depression. I never thought I had real depression though, just a series of bad days (the series lasted YEARS and I still didn't think it was REAL depression???). 
Eventually I tried to end it. It didn't work, so I tried harder 2 weeks later. I landed in the ICU for 3 days and a psych ward for a week. I was pissed. They made me start on meds and go to therapy 8 hours every day. When I got out, I spent the next 3 weeks with my family, so I couldn't try anything because everyone was watching me like a hawk. But over that month of being on meds, I gradually wanted to die less and less. I was still pretty unhappy, but not suicidal. 
I got up the courage, thanks to my husband, to go to a doctor and ask if there was anything else I could do to feel happy instead of just not suicidal. She prescribed two other meds, so now I take 3. They worked.
Now, I'm not just not suicidal, I'm consistently happy. It's something I haven't felt in 8 years. Every time I feel that joy a tear or 3 roll down my cheek because I spent the last 8 years miserable, when $20/mo of prescriptions would have changed that. I'm crying now typing this out. 
Now, when I face challenges, I want to figure out a way to overcome them instead of figuring out the most painless/clean way to die. I can genuinely smile again?? I want to keep the commitments I made to my friends? It's honestly kind of bewildering. 
I'm a little scared of happiness after these years, but it feels so good. The people around me seem more friendly because I'M more friendly. I thought it was just a bad day all this time when it was literally a chemical problem. It wasn't my fault, it wasn't some kind of moral failure. The meds worked, they fixed the chemical problem. 
I don't have a message here, except maybe try meds &amp; therapy if you're hesitant? I'm not trying to be preachy, I'm just overwhelmed. 
Please hang in there guys. You are worth it. You deserve it.",severe
"suicide note. : To Whom It May Concern, 
    If your eyes had the horrible misfortune of grazing this letter, just know I send my sincerest apologies and condolences to whoever actually deemed me as something to be worried about. It was very apparent that I was struggling with carrying myself anymore. I couldn’t manage to continue dragging myself from day to day knowing how much I just wanted to stop and end it all. I feel as though I had given life a good attempt, and from my perspective, I feel like I gave all the effort I could possibly have given the circumstances and challenges I was placed in. I know an abundance of you either won’t care or just be plain out disappointed in me. Truth be told, we all know this ending was eventually going to happen, but as humans, we all have a horrible habit of hoping when hope for the situation has run out. Either way, I know that for many of you the problems I faced were nothing compared to what many of you had to go through in your personal life, but I’m sorry for not being able to handle it. Although many of you will never admit it aloud, I know many of you will be relieved to not have to deal with this burden anymore. Truly though, I am a burden. I know many of you will deny this, but we all know this for a given fact. Someone wise once told me “Just because you don’t believe it and I don’t believe it, doesn’t mean it isn’t true.” And I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that it is true. I know I was never the greatest friend, I know I was just “too depressed” to be worthy of being good enough of a friend of knowing what was going on in friends’ lives. I was selfish my whole life. I never let anybody open up to me due to the fact that I opened up too much and let everyone see too much of me. I let people see the raw parts of me. Even in my last months of life, I never noticed that people created such a facade around me. No one was ever truly genuine with me, and I was so afraid of people treating me differently when I opened up about being depressed and suicidal and lonely, but  I didn’t know most of you already created a wall of bubble wrap for me before I told you all about the severity of it. You seemingly didn’t cushion me because you had been all along. I’m sorry though, that I opened up too soon and too fast and it tainted the genuinity I believed we had. I’m sorry many of you had to hide your own emotions due to the fact that I was considered unfit to hear other problems or worries or concerns. I’m sorry I was so broken that everyone felt the need to not push me past my invisible limit anymore. At the end of the day, I’m sorry to so many of you for not being there when you needed someone just as much as I did. Back to being a burden, I deeply apologize to the number of friends and family members I had given all my problems to, and I want you to know I have the utmost and sincere sympathy for anyone who will see my death as a final burden. It’s okay to be honest with yourself now though. I understand in full that I was a burden, and to whoever gains the worst opportunity in the world to read this, if you are shaking your head at the fact that I will always believe I am a burden, don’t doubt this truth because if I weren’t a burden to the world, then why was I treated like one. You don’t treat a concern like a burden. Like as if you wish you could just dump it in the ocean, or cut it off from your life, or hang it in your room. Burdens you deal with because you must, not because you want to. Many of you dealt with me not because you wanted to, but for your own personal sake, which is understandable. I just want you, whoever treated me like a burden, whoever dubbed me as a burden, whoever saw me as a burden, to know that you should have stopped being selfish and let me go. I suffered because I thought I mattered to you all. I suffered because you all gave me hope. If we ever meet again in another life, in the same situation, please let me go. More importantly though, I am not necessary or wanted. I know many people were sick of me in my last moments of life. It was very apparent to me. I know that in life and in the long run, no one is truly necessary and that life moves forward, whether or not I choose to be present for it. I, however, obviously chose to no longer be present for the continuous psychological pain I would have suffered. The “want” I wish people had for me was nothing close to present though. I could feel people growing bored with me, knowing and learning that I was someone who could be replaced. Nothing extraordinary. Nothing necessary. Nothing wanted. Don’t get me wrong, when I made it known how I felt, so many people had given me the time of day and made me feel wanted. However, the amount of significance I felt on the daily basis was little to none. It pains me in so many ways to know that I wasn’t important or necessary enough to anyone when it was a constant thing. I’m sorry I couldn’t bare to manage the pain I suffered. The amount of pain that has grown over the years has become overwhelming and has seemingly overcome me. I do not know who I am anymore, the wave of depression never seemed to cease and with it came the rough waves that seemed to wipe away me. I couldn’t continue. The loneliness was overwhelming. The surge of suicidal thoughts, the endless nights full of endless tears, the overbearing pressure that brings my heart down to the center of the earth, the unwillingness to continue anymore, and most of all the hopeless thoughts intruding my head when I attempt to reach for help. No matter how desperately I wanted to be helped, I couldn’t find it in me to make the call or send the text or talk about the pain. No matter how much I felt like I was suffocating and that the breath of fresh air my body and soul needed was a simple form of cellular contact which would take no more than a second, it felt like the glimmer of hope and the final reassuring breath I need to gain my composure is light years away. I give you my deepest apologies about not being able to be a fully functioning and happy human being. I’m truly and most sincerely sorry from every section of my heart that I couldn’t hold on and that I couldn’t wait a second for a glimmer of hope, or a chance to find the way out of my endless tunnel.

"I don't go to appointments, therapy, etc. and I don't know why. : WTF IS WRONG WITH ME? I'm the most anxious and stupid idiot out there. Or maybe I'm just lazy? Or both? I skip appointments so often. I used to skip 1 day of school every week. I got in a teen therapy group session which lasts for 8 weeks 8 am till 4 pm and guess what? I went on Monday after almost not going, then I skipped Tuesday till Friday (today). My anxiety won once again. They called my mom and told her that I have to come today or else they might call another teen to replace me on Monday. There is no way that I can come now. My anxiety is level 100 and I haven't slept at all today and yesterday. I fucking hate myself. I had this awesome opportunity to better myself and I fucking blew it. My therapist hates me now. The kids there probably hate me now as well, even though they didn't like me in the first place. The nurses there hate me now too (it's inside a Hospital). I hate this so much. Medication doesn't help and it seems like my psychatrist doesn't care at all. I want to rewind time. Or at least give me a second chance on Monday...  but I feel so bad that there's someone else waiting who needs it more than me. I don't deserve anything even remotely good in this life.

"How long do Mirtazapine side effects last? : [Throwaway account because my gf follows me]
My partner has just come off 2 months of 30mg mirtazapine for depression and anxiety, due to it not really helping, and because of the frustrating (mainly sexual) side effects (the usual, but far worse than other meds) that appeared as soon as she started taking it. 
This has obviously sucked for both of us, our sex life is nonexistent recently. Luckily we’re very open when it comes to things like this, so it didn’t cause any tension or frustration. 
I’m on sertraline and have been on other antidepressants, so I can empathise with what she’s feeling, but I’ve never been on mirtazapine, so my question to anyone with experience with this medication is:
Assuming you experienced similar problems, how long did it take for your sex drive to return, and were there any long term issues?

"First post. : I've been sitting for over an hour in the dark listening to music while trying to think of what to say. 
I guess that I just wanted to tell my story in segments on the forums from time to time and get things off my mind.
I'll start off by saying that I suffer from severe depression, among other things. I'm 32 years old and have tried to take my own life on a couple occasions. I'm not depressed at the moment.
I guess I'll start with saying my parents didn't have children to start a family like most couples. My father knocked up my mother when they were graduating. They had a shotgun wedding shortly before my older brother was born. My father had come from the country side with 8 siblings in total and planned to live in the country when he could buy a place. His mind set was that he wanted kids for free labor to help around the ranch. 
My dad drank, smoked, had a temper and would cheat on my mother. When I was younger I caught my father with another woman. She didn't even know that he had kids and I had stumbled upon them. He tried to hide it and introduced me as his son. They knew that they were caught and she ended up leaving. I had to be the one to tell my mother. But this apparently wasn't the first time that he cheated. It drove my mother a bit crazy and she questioned her self as being a good house wife and she would repeatedly ask me if she was a good house wife. My father is really manipulative and controlling. He also had a short temper and as my mother would call it, he would go red brained cause all he would see was red.
I was bullied as a young kid and moved around a lot. I changed schools five times so it was hard to make and keep friends. I came from the country so I didn't really get to hang out with other kids. That and I came from somewhat of a broken home. My dad wasn't allowed to chaperon field trips after a incident during a trip that involved him. I also was outcast by other kids for a bit by his actions. I also couldn't have other kids around my house as my father would do things around any friends that I brought over.  I made a couple friends at one school but they ended up moving away. I always kept to my self, just eating alone etc.
I don't celebrate my birthdays or Christmas. When I was growing up my birthdays were all pretty bad or we just didn't have them so I had just stopped trying to celebrate them. I don't even think we celebrated over half my birthdays due to my parents just not celebrating them. I remember one time I saved up money and wanted to go out for sushi. My mother said they couldn't afford it and I told her that I could pay for it, they could just drive me. They ended up leaving in the morning and left me at the house cause they said that they had to go do something (I can't remember). They were gone the whole day. I ended up making a package of noodles for supper on my birthday cause at the time that was all I could make. They came back at night time before I headed to bed. My parents ended up going out for supper and lunch. My dad also brought in a few hundred dollars of tools that he didn't need but bought any ways. 
They made a dentist appointment on another birthday and I needed to be put under with gas and that made me throw up all day after wards. They didn't plan anything for that birthday any ways so not like it mattered. Another birthday my parents told me that my father had to work and that they would have it on his days off but never did. Those were the good birthdays. 
When I was a teenager I knew I had to get away from my parents and so I worked for farmers when ever I could get away from working for my dad. My dad found out that I was working for another farmer on my time off and didn't like that one bit, he called up the farmer yelling at him told him not to hire me for any more jobs. Any ways I would do odd jobs or work as a ranch hand, rock picking fields or doing what ever I could in order to earn money. I saved up enough money and when I was sixteen I dropped out of school and moved out. I moved in with my older brother.
The day I turned 18 I started work at the local mine. After some time the bullying started up again. Workers would make up stories about me and would back stab in order to move up. I was blamed for things that I didn't do and people at the mines would vandalize the mines property. It was like school all over again. The someone spray painted my name with insults down in the tunnels. They would write stuff in the washroom stalls. Even new workers that I never met on other shifts would make stories up about me. Rumors spread around and I was constantly being called into the office. The supervisor knew the stories weren't true and talked with me about it. He knew I was being bullied and people were just trying to move up. 
In the spring the bullying got way worse and I tried to take my life. I failed and ended up in the psych ward. I quit my job and moved to a different town. I became more quiet and withdrew into a shell. Distancing my self from people.
That summer I met a woman like no other. She was working as a waitress. I was shy and would sit by myself. She would talk with me and treated me different then other people had treated me. I tried to work up the courage to ask her out. I even wrote my number on a napkin to give to her. But before I could give it to her she said ""I don't normally do this but if I give you my number would you call me"". I didn't hesitate to say yes. We started dating. I'm was gentleman, I held doors open for her, open the vehicle doors and helped her into them, walked on the outside of the sidewalks near the road, didn't swear, always paid for everything. 
She once surprised me, she said she wanted to treat me to a carnival ride, no one had ever done that for me before. When we were alone nothing else mattered. Time flew by yet we didn't seem to notice. In the fall I purposed to her, she said yes. I was so happy back then. She even convinced me to celebrate my birthdays. 
One day she sat me down and told me that she was pregnant. We were happy, I was happy. I would now know what it's like and get to experience what I was like to have a real family...
She was kind. Always looking out for me. She even talked me into going back and finishing school. So I did. I went through a store front school and graduated in two week. She always pushed my to be better and I wanted to be for her.
However happiness doesn't last forever. We went for a check up and the doctor discovered that she had cancer. They told her that she couldn't have the baby. They gave her two months to live. I couldn't speak. Every time I tried to opened my mouth I would start crying. Looking back at it now, I don't think I ever seen her cry. She would just look at me and smile. The only thing that I think she was most sad about was that the baby didn't get to experience this world. 
Once again I was going to be alone. I couldn't bare it and I tried to OD on a couple bottles of pills. Once again I failed to take my life. She was there and told me ""It's not your time"".  
She lived past the two month that the doctors gave her and past away in the summer. (Even now it's difficult for me to just type this as my eyes water up and my throat feels like it is closing up).
I just wanted to die. I stopped eating, All I could do is lay in bed for a year.  I hate my life. Good guys don't win or maybe it's just that I'm not a good guy. Idk.",severe
"I don't know what to do. : I posted this in another community and I thought I'd put it here too, why not.
I've  never posted something like this, but for once I've no one, nowhere and  not even the will to reach out in my personal life anymore. I have  nowhere else to turn.
I had a  psychiatry appointment today, one I've been waiting for for uite a  while, you could say I've been waiting nearly a year since being told  I'd be put straight into another mental health service and wouldn't be  left alone out in the deep end. You can probably guess where this  story's going.
The psychiatrist  heading the community service that I was in until this morning decided  to discharge me, against my wishes. She didn't allow me to speak in the  appointment. When I could get a few words in she would cut me off. She  wrote off some points that I wanted to bring up as simple personality  traits and that I can't compare myself to others, that each person is  different. Well if it were that simple I wouldn't be in the services.  She said that I shouldn't strive to label myself or something when I  brought up that I suspect I've autism. No matter how many times I said  how it's getting more and more difficult to exist in day to day life  with others I wasn't listened to.
She  told me what I thought, or what I went through. I said my last  psychiatrist dismissed a lot my issues. She said that he didn't, even  though these are two completely different services. This doctor in  particular stated that I don't have depression and the source of most of  my issues is me over exaggerating things in my head. Never got to say  that because she wasn't interested in listening to me.
From  the beginning she had an opinion of me that I felt like I was going to  have to fight against, and she never let go of it, leading her to  finally discharge me. She said that I don't appear to like the service,  that it's not beneficial, that I'm not happy with it and that I always  had something to say about it. From the beginning of my attendance to  this service I was never entirely sure of how I was being deal with. I  had a main appointment at the beginning where she had to get to know me  and my history. I was at the end of my rope at that point in my life due  to trying to finish school and being in an abusive relationship where I  was gaslit into thinking I was an awful broken person. I had very few,  maybe 2 max I think, ""check in"" appointments later where 2 different  doctors did just that, check in on me and asking basic uestions to write  down the answers to in my file. At these points in my life I was  cripplingly depressed, had no idea what was going on at all due to, yk,  trauma. My head was beyond broken and I couldn't articulate much other  than ""I feel terrible"" in those appointments. Today she backtracked on  those check-ins, that they were proper meetings, that I didn't like the  service sure I can't even make sense of what she said now as I'm writing  this. I had no appointment during the next period of my life where I  genuinely just wanted to do away with myself which is a sentiment that  has yet to leave me and has been massively exasperated from today.  One  of the doctor's even said in the meetings I've had before that there was  nothing he could really help me with because he didn't know me, that it  was a bit pointless to be doing mindfulness exercises, that he didn't  believe in half that shit. The other doctor ended up hugging me at the  end of our meeting because I was so fucking depressing. And today there  was this bitch again.
Apologies if the above paragraph isn't all that clear, I'm truly confused as to what my situation is too.
She  told me that I have no mental illnesses and cut me off whenever I tried  to say that I had no official diagnosis', just recommendations and  screenings because I never got the time of day anywhere. The only chance  that I had originally was the last psychiatrist that demeaned me. She  replied to me in these exact words: ""We're doctors, not imbeciles. These  doctors haven't found anything in you before. They would've seen  something if there was."" I had two check in appointments and that was  it. She also said that I've already been diagnosed with aspergers. I  haven't been, the child health service said it was a likely possibility  and wrote a recommendation about it in my file. I was seen very little  times because I was over 18 when they finally saw me. They told me  explicitly that this wasn't an official diagnosis. If it was, my  previous service would have known. She refused to listen and rejected  that.
I  began tearing up at some point, leading to full blown sobbing in the  end, to which her only response was (at the door to the office) \[name\]  come on, I have to move on to the next person.
I  broke down crying on the floor of the toilet inside. I couldn't go out  in public in that condition. This is possibly the lowest I've felt since  I: 1: Was left on the floor of my abusive ex boyfriend's floor to curl  into a fetal position and cry, and 2: Crying in the school bathroom and  cutting my arm after being demeaned by my principal for the sin of  reaching out for help.
This seuence of events has happened far too often for me to not give up finally, relapse into stuff or you know.",severe
"I hate the thought of living another day : I really hate my life and the shit cards I've been handed from birth. I am a 24 year old Male living in the UK with a metabolic disease, which means I was born with it, it causes intense pain in my hands and feet which means I'm mostly housebound apart from odd occasions and I am unable to work due to it.
I also have severe OCD that ruins whatever hobbies I have like gaming, films and TV so I'm just stuck in my house with nothing to do to enjoy what little life I have. It's more of a perfectionist type OCD where I need to do things perfectly and plan things in advance which makes my hobbies tedious and tiring.
I also have Aspergers so I just come across as socially awkward and I only have one friend which I met online which lives in Canada so I only ever talk to her through the Internet and due to the time differences, it's difficult to. Her day starts when it's 4 PM here but she works and I do hear from her while she is at work, for now but that might be changing soon. When she gets home, it's early morning here so I can't talk to her then because I need to go to bed. When she's finished what she's doing for the day and she's chilling out, I can't talk to her because once again, even if I stay up,  that won't be until 6 AM here. I can't go online and play games with her due to this as well as other reasons unless I'm willing to stay up all night and day or get up at 5 AM. At weekends she's usually busy so talking to her is rare.
I also have health anxieties surrounding Cancer that makes me worry everytime I find something on my body.
I just feel like I can't do anything with my life, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, I can't work to earn more money, I can't enjoy myself with the money I have due to the low income and severe OCD. I can't leave the house due to my disability. I find it hard to make friends due to being housebound and being socially awkward due to my Aspergers. I can't visit my friend in Canada due to low income and where she lives. I feel so alone and I feel like death would be a better option than living another day. I just really hate my life and I feel like this is going to be it for the rest of my life.

I got discharged from the military nearly 8 years ago with PTSD and spent the last 6-7 years living with family but not really being able to maintain any kind of relationships. I recently got my own place and for the past few months been feeling lonelier and lonelier. I feel so sick to my stomach when I think about how socially awkward I am even at my current job.

"Literally, what is the point? : In 2017, heartbreak launched me in into the worst depressive episode I’ve ever had; like, I’ve suffered with some form of mental illness since I was about 12 and it all felt like the Golden Years compared to this. My friends totally dropped me, I barely scraped out of school, I had to move home with my parents—one of whom is suffering from Parkinson’s. Even with that aside, my relationship with them has always been complicated. 
After my lowest point—the day I realized that if I killed myself, it would take days before anyone even noticed—it took about a year for me to just reach functional, and another one to feel somewhat normal. And even now, I have ups and downs. Therapy and medication have helped loads, but I still struggle in my professional and love life—can’t seem to pin that “big girl job” that pays big girl money and haven’t gotten laid in actual years. Still, I want to keep pushing forward and become my best self.
But when I look at the world, it’s like, what is the point? I have these dreams of finding someone I love, writing books, traveling, having kids, hosting Christmas parties...and none of it will ever happen because the world is actually fucking ending. Even before this Covid stuff; our politicians and  government is corrupt and will never change, the environment is collapsing, we all hate each other. Even if we somehow survive, we may have to live through some sort of civil war or who the fuck knows.

"Dealing with depression and GAD when alone : Like many people at the moment, I'm spending a lot of time alone and keeping my distance from my friends and family. It's the advice for those of us who have a flu-like symptom. I have a slight cough, which might well be bought on by medication, but it's enough for me to be responsible and self-isolate. 
Anyway, I've recently been diagnosed with depression and GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) and I'm starting my sessions in CBT, and it was going well and I'm starting to learn that I've been living with this 'hum' of depression and GAD for a couple of years, and it's been a trigger for negative reactions and dark days. I'd started to make progress with the therapist in understanding where these voices come from, but this is very early in my journey. 
Today has been hard. I'm at home, alone and reading the news about CORVID, looking at data and the 'what ifs' start in my head again and the scenarios I imagine are darker each time. To the point where, knowing that I'm not showing any of the symptoms, hugging my eldest kid makes me tear myself apart with guilt. 
What I need at the moment are tool and mechanisms to deal with this. How do you   
A) keep those noises from your head  
B) Stop them when they start
I have a call with my GP on Tuesday about issues that are linked with this, as I think I'm actually now at the point where I need medication, as a total breakdown is now a daily occurrence when it used to be an annual thing. So, hopefully, more long-term and sustainable help is on the way, but I've still got 4 days to get through before that call, so any advice is welcome!",severe
"“Why don’t you try to change” : I’m super frustrated. I just need to vent, so please bear with me.
I basically explained to my roommate that I know that I am generally hated/disliked, to which she asked me why I say that. I also said, I know this is the way it is, and I can’t change myself. I’ve tried and it only hurts me. People won’t like me that way, I am well aware from trial and error.
I can read other people very well. This is part of where my anxiety comes from. I very well know that people don’t like me. They don’t have to be outright mean to be rude, you know? It always hurts, no matter how long I’ve dealt with it. I have experienced this discomfort with the way people view me my entire life. I know that people don’t like me, it’s simply a matter of fact. 
I have genetic anger issues. I cannot stop myself from becoming infuriated, and I even take medication for it. Still, sometimes my frustration leaks through. This often caused me trouble in my youth, as I was very easy to tease. I cry when I’m angry. I stutter, too. I think forever about what I could have said or done in that
 moment. I lived in a conservative community, and I became very liberal in my later years. I made really incredible friends by pure luck, and while they are few, they are everything to me. Still, it’s like a bandaid on a broken bone.
I’m too uncomfortable to use social media because I can’t gain a following or deal with the fact that I’m displaying myself to be viewed and judged by others. I only use reddit and snapchat
these days. 
I’ve had depression for about five years. I’m medicated and I distract myself from most of my issues in not very proactive ways, but it gets the job done. Nowadays, I don’t dwell on it too much, but it always comes crawling back. Especially since I’ve finally come out as trans, and I’m dealing with (by no means terrible) backlash from my family and others around me. I’m constantly questioning myself, and sometimes when I dwell on it for too long, I become paralyzed with fear and misplaced regret. 
I wish I was quieter. I wish I wouldn’t talk about my feelings so much. I wish I opened my mouth less, and kept my opinions to myself. But I can’t stand the audacity of others, who run their mouths in ignorance. It’s literally infuriating, and I snap back. I cannot help myself. 
Truly, I cannot help myself. I can’t help myself be more liked. I can’t stop myself from being who I am. I’m exhausted of being looked down upon for my methods and ideas. 
When I was fourteen, I worked in this place with a bunch of peers who didn’t like me at all. There was a big mirror that I’d pass constantly, and everytime I passed it, I would think, “there’s something wrong with me.” I used to want to disappear so badly. I would cry almost every day. 
Now I’m grown and in a much better place, but from time to time, that thought crosses my mind. I am inherently different. There is a glitch in my system. I am fucked up. Not because I’m queer or anything. I’m just messed up. I wish so badly that I could help myself, but I don’t know how. 
How do I manage this general dislike I have congregated for myself? Not just from myself, but from others as well. I don’t hate myself, but I certainly don’t like myself, either. I want to be better, not just in the realm of my mental state, but towards others. I want to be the person I’ve always aspired to be. That’s not someone who is super cool or well liked, just someone who speaks knowledgably and lives beyond this world. I don’t want to be so engrossed in this anymore.",severe
"suicidial thoughts on medical record? UK anxiety/depression/ ADHD : Hi All,
i have recently been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder
i am currently renewing my car insurance and do i have to state this on the new policy and how much would it go up by roughly if anyone knows?

if you can also ellobarote abit more on how this could effect me in the future terms as well as it would be very much helpfull.
the only reason i had been depressed and had anxiety is because i believe i have not been diagnosed with ADHD which has caused this, which i have been refferred to a adult psycologist which can take upto a year. but i want to go private just waiting on recieving some funds from work to carry this out. if you can point out the best and cheapest options available it would be helpfull.

"I drink to sleep better : I'm a highschooler and I've had insomnia for about 5 years now. Ik that alcohol is proven to worsen sleep but for me, instead of waking up every 3-4 hrs or not falling asleep till 3 hours after I get into my bed, a few shots before I get into bed helps me just breathe better and wake up less. This has been my schedule for a several months. I still wake up in the night but it's less often and when I wakeup I dont feel so angry at myself and i feel kinda light headed ina good way so i fall back asleep faster. 
My sleep is better but ik sooner or later my bodys gonna show the effects of  the alcohol soon. I already developed  stomach gastritis  last year and ik the alcohol  wont help it at all. 
None of my friends  or family know this. I told my best friends  once but it was by text and they may have skipped reading it so I'm assuming they dont know.",severe
"Impending cycle of doom : I need help. I recently got out of an inpatient facility which was great, and now I’m back out in the world. Well, not really. I’m doing an outpatient program which is helpful and all but I always want to cut myself. I don’t want to die but the urge to cut is overwhelming. A plus, I think all my friends hate me. Before I was inpatient I was going through a really rough time with a few people at school and they really abandoned me when I needed them most. I mean they just really shit on me when I already wanted to kill myself. I told my friend that I wanted to kill myself and was pretty convinced that I was going to and he shrugged it off. Didn’t tell anyone or express concern which was disappointing but I guess you can’t ask people to always do that right thing. Luckily I broke down and therapy and ended up in the ER before I could overdose on ativan, trazedone, and vodka. I’m out now and doing better but my friends are being shit and I’m really craving to cut. It’s fucked up but the feeling of cutting is indescribable and impossible to duplicate. I guess I don’t want to but I don’t know how to stop myself.",severe

"i was recently diagnosed with depression : Hello, as my titled says, I was recently diagnosed with depression. I don’t know where else to tell my story but I feel like I need to do it to prevent myself from doing something bad. I’m 18, I live in France and i’ve started going to college in September. Since then, I was feeling really off, as if I was some kind of second character in other people’s lives, but also in my own. I was feeling really lonely, but seeing my other friends feeling the same way reassured me in this feeling. However, as the time went by, I saw those same people gradually becoming better while I wasn’t, and I started losing contact with them. I used to be really friendly, always laughing and going out, while being really dedicated to my studies. Since then, it’s just as if everything just started becoming black. I’ve lost interest in going out, making jokes and laughing didn’t light the same sparkle in me, studying made me feel dumb and empty. I constantly feel like i’ve chosen the wrong path, but feel like i’m not good enough for another one, and i always wanted to come back to my parents but i wasn’t feeling right in my place anywhere. It started to became more and more frequent, with thoughts of quitting everything, or that I didn’t belong anywhere, etc. I didn’t want to go out anymore, or when I did, I just needed to drink to feel in a right headspace, or else I just felt as if I was standing aside of my own body, not knowing how to act or what to say to make believe that I was doing okay when really I wasn’t. I started to see my college’s psychologist but he really didn’t help me and instead made me feel really weird about myself and the way I felt. I spoke about it to my mother, which wasn’t that concerned because I hadn’t told her yet that I was thinking a lot about death and suicide. She helped me find a psychologist, which I started to see every week, since february. She immediately told me that she thought I had depression and needed to take medicine, and so I had to go see a psychiatrist to get them. With my psychologist, we talk a lot about my life in the past and how I could see the world as another point of view, and she makes me think of a lot of things about me, but really she just points out a lot of things that i do or am that kind of make me sad about myself. What really scared me is that I usually enjoyed a lot going to concerts, which made me really happy and the last two i went to made me feel so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to go out before the end. I was really disappointed towards myself. By then, I tried going to several places to find a psychiatrist but no one helped me or took me seriously and I felt like I would never be helped, and I felt like I didn’t really want to on the inside. I wrote a suicide note, and I was ready to try to kill me. My boyfriend saw it and he prevented my mother, which came by me crying saying she didn’t know I had the intention to do it. We went to a hospital to seek medical help but there were a lot of kids who were really sick and I didn’t feel at the right place at all. We finally found a psychiatrist, which diagnosed me with depression, and anxiety. She gave me meds that I have to take daily and are supposed to make me feel happy again. I hate it because everytime I want to swallow the entire pack, whether it is to die or get better quicker. I started questioning myself if I had always been depressed. I’ve always felt as if I wasn’t part of this world in some way, or that I didn’t deserve to be here.
Now, i’m not better at all but I like writing down my feelings. I’m living normally and i’m trying to do stuff to keep me occupied but i’m always bored because I always want to do something but I never know what; I’m vainly angry at people that love me because they love me; when i cross a crosswalk I always think of a car hitting me and then of me suffering; I always want to sleep to forget that im alive; When I laugh I feel like I shouldn’t be doing it; I feel like i’m not really depressed because my problems aren’t important; I feel like i’m useless and that I’ll never be important to anyone; I feel like my life is pointless and that it’ll never change; I feel like I should always excuse myself because I’m not a good person; I feel like the ugliest person in the world; and sometimes I just burst into tears because it is just too much and the weight is too heavy and I want to take it off. 
That’s my story dealing with depression. Everyday I wake up knowing that one day I’ll take my life away, but I want to get better; because people get hurt because of me. I’m hurting them because I deeply hate myself and I’m constantly fighting against myself. 
I hope i’ll get better.",severe
"I'm (19f) trying not to bring down my friend's (22m) mood : I go through these weird cycles of being in a really great mood and feeling positive &amp; courageous &amp; like I can do anything, but then plummeting into a really dark depressive state for twice as long. And that's kind of where I feel myself going right now. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed but also overwhelmed, and I'm starting to feel the joy flicker out. My last day off from both jobs was Feb. 20th &amp; my next day off isn't until March 19th, and even though I only have a week left until I get there, it's one day and then I'm back to at least 1-2 weeks with no day off. I'm feeling burned out from work, and between never having a lot of time or every, and my insecurities I've been struggling to eat. I've struggled with an eating disorder for a long time on my own and sometimes when I get depressed I forget to eat and then when I do get hungry I feel guilty. Stupid, I know, but it is what it is. Okay so now that you have some backstory/context of what I'm feeling, here's my current problem; 
I've sparked up a friendship with this guy recently (met through reddit, he's British &amp; I'm American) and as silly as it sounds I just connected with him so well. We've been talking every day for a few weeks and we send each other snapchats &amp; voice memos all the time. We've both already admitted to having a crush on each other but we're still just friends &amp; we do a lot of encouraging each other as he seems to deal with similar emotions &amp; doesn't get a lot of sleep. We both always dread work and feel exhausted by our day but today for me was just draining on such an intense level that didn't really hit me until I got home. I want to talk about it with him since I don't feel like I have anyone else to talk to but he told me about how good his day way &amp; how positive he's feeling and I really really don't want to ruin that for him. It makes me really happy that his day was so good &amp; he deserves to sit in that positivity. I don't want him to have to comfort me or feel bad for me, but it's just hard not telling anyone. So here I am, using reddit as a way to get it out of my system. I try so hard to find ways to feel good and stay hopeful when I feel myself getting into that's his negative state of mind but it's just so hard when the work I put into it comes up with very small results. I just wish I could sink into the floor for a month or so then come back up when things start feeling more lighthearted.",severe
"I really don’t see any reason to continue living... : I recently found out that because of the medication I’ve been taking for the past 10 years, I’m at high risk of PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction), loss of emotions, Anhedonia, impaired cognitive thinking, lack of empathy, etc. Tbe risks are LONG-TERM, EVEN LIFELONG for some people. I take the highest dose for these 10 years as well, making me even more at risk.
I already experience extents of all of these things sometimes, so I highly expect to be affected if, or more likely when (due to most likely inevitable loss of health insurance) I discontinue my meds, a slow taper is said to NOT prevent the risks.
I’m 24, live with my parents, failed my driving test (never been very comfortable with driving, but not driving has been life crippling), been extremely socially isolated for years, have no friends (not even online anymore, it just felt pointless continuing to talk to people I’d never see in real life), never had a girlfriend and I’m a goddamn virgin who’s never even kissed.
A girl on Whisper just roasted me for implying we should hookup before we die from the CoronaVirus, I didn’t have the balls to follow through anyway, I can’t leave the house with being questioned, even if my parents aren’t home, the cameras send notifications to all of our phones. Explaining this kind of thing would be VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
I told the girl I was not a player, and it was important to me that she enjoyed it. She told me I was worse than the perverts who message her, because I didn’t even offer to buy her dinner.
She ten accused me of being unable to get pussy and living in my mom’s basement, which (apart from the basement part, to be technical) is pretty spot on.
I then opened up with honesty about my depression and told her I’m sorry and I’ll leave her alone. She didn’t respond again.
Yes, I’m 24 and still at home, and securing a basic job bagging groceries like a teenager’s first job has been a huge accomplishment for me. And I just started community college spring 2020. Being 24, my financial aid is plentiful and safe, because it requires MY OWN financial information and NOT MY PATIENTS (one of my classmates recently got dropped out due to losing financial aid, good Ol America).
Socially, the only way it’s better than grade school is I’m not bullied. But nobody really talks to me either, and I feel more cut off from humanity than exes, despite being surrounded by people everyday (school and work).
Due to my living situation (can’t drive, live with parents, have such a bottom level job) I’m way too insecure to even try and make friends, I know people will judge me. Asking out women? Forget about that completely.
I am not, never have been, and never will be, an extrovert.
I already know I’m widely considered unattractive, but I don’t think that is the true biggest barrier, I think it is to do with my social skills and insecurity. 
I’m being expected to be more and more independent and responsible at my age, and in less than a couple of years, legally kicked off of my parents health insurance, and it’s highly unlikely the job I have now will provide that even by then.... 
And to know that the chemicals/neurotransmitters in my brain have been, and/or will be altered so greatly that I will be incapable of basic human feelings and functionings, not even being a human being anymore, is the most terrifying thing I’ve ever faced in my life. There is no cure, or treatment? for PSSD and the other Post SSRI long-term/life-long side effects.
Doctors do not take PSSD/long-term/permanent SSRI side effects seriously, and even if they did, they would be unable to do anything about it.
My doctor has been to trigger happy in raising dosages just for me having any amount of depression, anxiety, anger, etc. left. 
I was put on Oxcarbazepine 600 MG twice a day and Sertraline 200 MG a day 10 years ago for life crippling OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). And more recently, Bupropion SR 100 MG a day to get my rage outbursts under control, as I was becoming a danger to myself and others, and at serious risk of ending up getting arrested with how explosive my rage was.
My doctor asked me if I still had any depression, anger, anxiety, etc. A couple of months later, and immediately upon saying yes, doubled my Bupropion SR to 200 MG a day. About a week later, he told me I could cut back to 100 MG, as I was suffering from worsened anxiety, and worse sexual dysfunction (which I didn’t mention).
I only care about my sexual functioning because I was holding hope, that id get to use it, one day, hopefully while still in my 20s.....
Ironically, I wished away my sexuality and even my emotions just days before the doubled dose seemed to grant my wish, causing me serious regret.
I seem to have returned to baseline of before the Bupropion SR was doubled, but my ejaculate volume is still much lower (before I cummed A LOT).
After the effects of double Bupropion SR I found out about PSSD from Googling my symptoms, and I fell down the rabbit hole. I’ve been worried about this 24/7 ever since. So about a month now....
I’m still worried about the inevitable likely forced cutoff of my medication, permanently (or even if it’s just for a few years, still serious) disabling me (it can even go beyond sexual functioning) and being uninsured will only hurt even more as a vegetable. I also have to worry about becoming severely disabled from OCD returning full-blown.
If I want to pay so I can lose my virginity, even that has a time limit if losing my meds means losing my libido, and/or at the least even less pleasurable orgasms...
This SSRI BULLSHIT just reinforces my feelings of being sexually worthless, and just not being a human being.",severe
"Looking for an advise to overcome my lifetime depression. Meditation? Morning routines? Thank you all in advance. : Hello there..
Ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety (I know, the basics right?) since I was 16 yo. Although I’ve had many other diagnosis through all this time (ADD, OCPD, Bipolar Disorder, Etc, etc etc) , any way I couldn’t care less for a diagnosis right now. I am now 28 yo and I’ve been around 20 different psychologists, around 8 psychiatrists, many analysis, and several different meds (clonazepan, methylphenidate, fluvoxamine, VPA, fluoxetine, bromazepam, alprazolam, blah, blah blah..) And I’ve been interned 2 times into hospitals because of my panic attacks. Is good to say that i have never been addicted to anything but my negative thoughts, and I am only taking bromazepam (because I’m dependent to it) and fluoxetine as my anti depressive. This meds helps me no to go “useless” but not really helping me to be happier.  And at this point I am really tired to try new meds or put more things into my body. I have smoked weed before, stopped because of my paranoia, and the alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs i rarely use them because I try to be as mentally healthy as possible, and I can barely handle their side effects. I tried psychedelics once in order to try to have an eye opening experience and overcome my traumas, but again, my paranoia made it worse. So I’m done with all the medics, gurus, substances, and all that.
Right now I work as a Sales Manager in a multinational corporation, I graduated from a prestigious university, I rent an apartment, and from the outside you could tell that everything is fine. The thing is that even with my meds my bad days are heavier every time. I have social anxiety, (and work on sales, imagine that), in the last 5 years i barely go out from my house, my friends or colleges barely know about what happens to me, people always ask me where have you been all this time?? You disappear!! , because all I do is work and I’m so ashamed to go outside because I don’t feel happy enough, worthy enough, rich enough, cool enough, handsome enough, that i prefer to stay at home doing nothing, and regretting it. I don’t exercise, don’t eat healthy, don’t have any long time hobbies (although people think I do), I am gaining waight, loosing hair because of stress, failing and failing again on my attempts of getting my shit together. So my attacks are getting worse, can barely wake up, and when I do is because I’m too afraid to lose the job I hate. I have 5 really close friends that i count on, but I try not to contagious them with my negativity, i divorced from my parents since they are not a healthy relationship for me. I am only chid. And I feel so alone. 
Anyway, I’m here because ive always look for better ways to re-program my mind in order to heal/overcome my situation and be the best person I can. I want what I think most of us wants. To be happy and fulfill. To have great human interactions, financial independence, great health, athletic body, social life, romance, hobbies. All that... but I feel helpless..
Ive tried to put morning habits, exercise routines, meditation practices (shakra, zhineng qigong, wim hof meditation, etc.) but all of those attempts feel like a greater defeat every time, and i am desperate because the problem is within me, and I’m waisting my life in my regretting and in my anger. 
My brain sabotages my body.. 
Have you passed over something similar and overcome it? How? 
Does anybody know a formula step by step to overcome this shit?
What can I do to not to feel this miserable? Something I can put on work? 
How can I truly change the way I think???
I lost hope but somehow I felt that this is the place to have the answers if I ask for the right questions

"A Comprehensive Guide To Slowly Getting Better, And Not Losing Hope. : In no way am I an expert, and in no way have I mastered these points, but I have had depression for about 4 years now, and I have seen what works and what doesn’t, and I wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. Depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but I believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub. 
I write this because it makes me feel better, and because I like to help other people. It makes me less depressed. If someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, I will be happy and grateful for it. Being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves. 
In no way are these ordered from most important to least. 
In no way am I suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self-hatred. I do not see hope for myself, but I believe in it regardless. I hope you can too. 
**Exercise Daily -** 
Do something you like. It doesn’t have to be the most intense, fat-burning, crazy workout. All I’m saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. Go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. Try out the gym for a couple months, aiming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. Try going and being active a couple times a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. It can be anything from karate to chess (trust me, this actually burns a significant amount of calories!), from swimming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a Shaolin Monk 
**Eat Healthy -** 
We always hear this one, and for good reason! It’s simple, but it gets hard, doesn’t it? We want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. I’m not saying pizza is off the table forever, but I’m saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. Try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! Contrary to popular belief, healthy food CAN taste good. 
**Take Vitamins -**
Many depressed people have low levels of Vitamin D (like me) so I take those regularly alongside some Magnesium supplements. I believe overtime this will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical imbalance a different way. 
**Take Meds If You Need Them -** 
Talk to someone. If they suggest pills, try them out. I have had pills that swung me the right way (Lexapro), and I have had pills that swung me a very, very bad way (some green looking pill, I don’t remember what it was but I hated it dude). Everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. Just… try it. I know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pills for depression and taking pills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. Not a cure, but a step. 
**Journal -** 
This is a big one for me. I have kept up journaling ever since I was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. Writing things down (like this) has a way of soothing the soul, I think. Write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. Write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. Write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy; hopefully at some point. 
**Clean Your Room -** 
I suck at this, but there’s something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. Put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. Get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. You’ll feel better, trust me. 
**Read -** 
This is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but I do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. No, not a book that you hope will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. Read Matilda for all I care! I read that book in one toilet session and I felt GREAT the rest of the day. 
**Go Outside Once a Day -** 
All I’m saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the “funk” it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something.   
**General Hygiene -** 
Big one. This is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. You’ll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. Take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, trim your beard, de-odor yourself, whatever! You’ll feel slightly better if you look and smell better. 
**Sleep Well -** 
I’m talking 8 hours at night and not throughout the day. Don’t waste the day away by taking little naps all the time. Do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. You will feel better. You won’t be cured, but you’ll feel better. Your body needs this, friend. 
**Wake Up Early -** 
Again, this might not be for everyone (as a matter of fact, who IS it for really), but trust me when I say that almost EVERY TIME I wake up early and do some stuff I like, the rest of the day feels better because I did something productive at the start of it. I get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it’s great! 
**Be Wise With Money -** 
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect a lot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction. 
**Compliment People, Spread Positivity, Without Expecting Anything in Return -** 
This is a great one. Even if you don’t believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. Everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. Here’s the catch: don’t do it for your own gain. Do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. You want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise. 
**Don’t Stay in Your House or Room for Too Long (Poor timing on this one, I know. But go for a walk or something) -** 
This comes at an awkward timing, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. My worst days are when I’m just scrolling Reddit or Pornhub or Facebook and when I’m just… wasting myself away. Get out of your room, be productive, do something. 
**Serve Other People in Some Way -** 
This is a bit different from complimenting people, but the premise is the same. Help others. Join a non-profit organization and help out once a week. You meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. There’s nothing like it! You are DOING something amazing, even if it is small. You are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. Do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. This could REALLY change your life, as it has mine. 
**Get Together With Friends -** 
Get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. Whether it's at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, ANYTHING. Just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. This may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago (and all of high school too), but try it out. The right people will come, I’m sure of it. 
**Call Family -** 
Whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. It has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, disconnection, abuse; anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. But sometimes you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other. 
**Listen to Music -** 
Duh! We all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. For me it’s Coldplay and a little known artist named Chris Renzema. They have been with me through ups and downs (lots of downs). I also listen to William Augusto Instrumentals as I fall asleep each night. Very helpful. 
**Try Out Therapy for a Couple Months -** 
It can be scary, I know. And for me personally therapy didn’t even fully work out for me. But this doesn’t mean I didn’t try it. I tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because I didn’t feel any differently. This won’t be the same for everyone. At least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend. 
**Limit Screen Time if you Can Help it -** 
Less time on the phone, less time on the computer, less time on the TV. All great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? Find a schedule that works for you. I personally am trying to lower my screentime on my phone to 5 hours a day, and eventually to 2 hours. Small goals, one step at a time. 
**Make Daily To-Do Lists -** 
Most days, in the morning or the day before, I create a to-do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. I even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what I accomplished and so I can put a little checkmark besides it! 
**Take Care of a Pet -** 
I recently got a Bearded Dragon (his name is Henry), and it has given me something new to live for and protect. As someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. Many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. Send me pictures of them so I can tell you how cute they are. 
**Be In Nature -** 
I believe this is for everyone. Get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. Try to travel to a National Park at some point, and take in the sights. Go for a short hike and look at the trees. We are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it. 
**NoFap, NoPorn -** 
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect alot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction. 
**Practice Gratitude -** 
Stay thankful for the things that you have. Whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. Just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. Again, I do this too, so let’s get better together. 
*Now, I am a devout Protestant Christian, and I wanted to include my Christian side to this equation. This is the most important part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason I am still alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step.* 
**Pray (For Others and Yourself) -** 
Thank the Lord for the people around you. Voice your anger towards Him. Talk to Him throughout the day, Ask Him to reveal Himself to you and to show you how much He truly loves you. He will do it, for a good Father wants His sons and daughters to be comforted in the midst of a crooked and twisted place that we live.
**Read The Bible -** 
This is the thing upon which we compare everything else. This is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the Lord speaks to His people through His Word. Learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the One who Loves us. 
**Meditate -** 
Christians meditate too! Take time in silence and align yourself with the Holy Spirit, as He speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth. 
**Get Together with Church Community -** 
Get together with others. Ask your questions. Break bread. Share stories. Encourage one another. Learn from the lesson preached by the pastor. Learn. Listen. Grow. Love.
All I’m saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the “funk” it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something. 
Take time alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in Jesus name, or are still depressed this side of eternity and are still trusting in the direction of the One who gave it all for them.

"I don’t think college is right for me : TW: suicide mention
When I (18F) graduated high school, I had no idea where I wanted to go. I skipped the fall semester and found an online college to join for the spring. The semester is wrapping up and I’m miserable. I only took three classes but it still feels overwhelming. I’m not doing well in any of them, but I can’t bring myself to tell anyone. 
I started going to therapy only to stop after three weeks because it wasn’t helping. I take antidepressants but they also don’t seem to be helping. I write in a diary every night, so I have a place to write down my feelings, but even that doesn’t help me anymore.
I haven’t been sleeping well at all since classes started in January. The other night while I was lying there, I was seriously debating suicide. The only thing that stopped me was worrying about how it would affect my sisters (9 + 15 years old). I feel so hopeless and confused right now, but getting this out feels really nice. 
Any advice/kind words?",severe
"Please help: Severe insomnia affecting me in many ways : So I've been really down recently for multiple reasons: my BDD, depression, anxiety all struck back at the same time and at first, I was just sleeping late coz I couldn't fall asleep but then it escalated to sleeping when the sun's up and waking when it's dark. I've got assignments and online classes going on and a long list of lectures to listen to in a subject I absolutely hate. I eat two meals a day since I wake up at odd hours (sometimes 6pm, sometimes 1pm, sometimes 4pm) and my body can't adjust to my sleep schedule. I feel worse ever since I've gotten this serious insomnia because not only does it make me feel horrible for not being able to sleep when I'm sad and tired, it's preventing me from being a physically healthy person. I've had a Napoleon complex for too long and my father told me our family has always been a long line of late bloomers. I really need the sleep and the food to grow. But I just can't have them. When I wake up, it's always to sit in front of my laptop and listen to lectures I hate listening to at 2x speed and 0 comprehension. Recently, my vision definitely got worse and my hair is falling out too. My brain can't seem to function well I'm misreading stuff and making simple grammatical mistakes in my writing/daily convo. Someone please help, what is wrong with me? I just want to be happy, healthy and normal. 
Thanks for reading. Sorry if I don't reply, I'm really tired. (I pulled two all nighters in a week trying to adjust my sleep schedule).",severe
"With each passing day my depression is getting worse and worse, I don’t know what I’m going to do : I’ve been having problems with depression for a while now, starting since around 6th grade. It wasn’t too bad, it didn’t affect me too severely, but I didn’t know how to handle it. I never learned how to. So I kept everything to myself. I never reached out, I never asked for help, I didn’t want to bother anybody. Over the years, it has been gradually getting worse and worse, I started hating myself and everything else more and more, I started having these terrible thoughts. I had no clue what to do. I kept doing what I had always done, not tell anyone. Act like I could do it on my own. Here I am, in 10th grade, feeling the worse I have ever felt. My grades have been dropping, even when we were in school and now in online school, my dad has abandoned the family to cheat on my mom, my grandpa has died, my mom is in complete shambles, and here I am stuck at home, laying in bed for hours each morning, eating so little food. These thoughts of me hating myself and thinking horrible things has become normal, I’m used to it, I’ve accepted that I’m a bad person. And the worst part is I finally did reach out, about a month ago. I’m seeing a therapist now. My mom (somewhat) knows what’s happening. And I feel absolutely no different than I did before. None of it is helping, it’s as if I did nothing. And I’m scared. I feel like I’ll never get better, that it’ll only get worse from here. I feel like I’m going to drive everyone away from me. I feel like I’ll do awful things. I don’t know what will happen. I just want everything to be fine. But how do I know that’ll ever happen?",severe
